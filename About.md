Heya, I'm Zinzy, and I've been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

I'm a lifelong learner from Amsterdam who likes to write. Often, I do so on this website, a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.

I'm an amateur musician, a swimmer, a curious home cook, a fan of short stories and comics, an urbanite, and a [cinephile](/tag/cinema/). I love teaching myself new things, and currently you can find me diving head-first into minimalist compositions for the piano.

In Amsterdam's finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I share a shoebox and a petit garden with Anja, and soon also puppy [Lemonade](https://lemonade.waleson.us/).

### My work
I'm a Design Manager at [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl), where we bring a data-driven approach to equitable education. For 16 years, I've been making a living by building digital products. Drawing from training in research, cultural analysis, linguistics, and — yes god — theology, I now focus on helping companies leverage UX research and design to solve problems for their curstomers.
 
I'm at my best dreaming big and working small to improve habits, teams, products, and services. Being a catalyst for better collaboration and design thinking is possibly my favorite thing in the world. My biggest strength is also my biggest weakness — I see things and ask "Okay great, but why?"

### Facilitation
A lifelong proud member of the queer community, as indicated by the lesbian cowboy shirt in my first-grade school picture, I build resonant queer spaces where people connect and recharge. Currently, you may find me on the Internet at [Vine & Fig](https://vineandfig.co/), and in Amsterdam at [Queer Salon](https://meetup.com/queersalon).
