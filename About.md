      <h3 class="mb-3">I’m a learner and sometimes I make things about what I learn. Since I was a child, the Internet has been a medium I use to do so.</h3>   
      <p>I'm a Santomean-Dutch queer person who grew up in the Dutch South. These days, home is Amsterdam. There, in its finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I share a shoebox with Anja, and soon also puppy Lemonade.</p>
      <p>In my spare time I like to make music, swim, write, cook, read short stories and comics, enjoy the city, and explore cinema. I like to teach myself new things, and currently I’m diving head-first into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWu9VxVQ6Lg&ab_channel=IgnasMaknickas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimalist compositions for the piano</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">For 16 years I’ve had the pleasure of making a wild variety of things for the Internet.</h3>

      <p>Drawing from training in research, linguistics, literature, and — yes — theology, I current work as a Design Manager at edtech scale-up <a href="https://leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>.</p>
      <p>I love dreaming big and working small to improve habits, teams, products, and services. Being a catalyst for better collaboration and design thinking is possibly my favorite thing in the world.</p>


I'm glad you made it to my personal website. It's a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.

I'm Zinzy, a Santomean-Dutch queer person who grew up in the Dutch South. These days, home is Amsterdam. There, in its finest neighborhood, I share a shoebox with [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/anjawaleson/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55) (and soon also a puppy).

In my spare time I like to make music, swim, write, cook, enjoy the city, and explore cinema. I like to teach myself new things, and currently I'm diving head-first into the piano.

### About my work
For 16 years, I've been making a living by building digital products. Drawing from training in research, linguistics, literature, and — yes — theology, I current work as a Design Manager at edtech scale-up [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl).

I love dreaming big and working small to improve habits, teams, products, and services. Being a catalyst for better collaboration and design thinking is possibly my favorite thing in the world.
