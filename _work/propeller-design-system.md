When I transitioned from leading the front-end team to building a design department at Airtrade, there were countless matters that needed attention. We were on the cusp of a redesign of our white label B2C platforms, soon to be followed by an entirely new flagship enterprise platform, our outdated tools could use some polishing up, and there was no real process in place for validating ideas and aligning with our clients.

<div class="subheader">Why</div>
### Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

- **Productivity:** concepting, decision-making, hand offs... every part of the product cycle was a bit of mess.
- **Debt:** Custom style definitions had accumulated a worrying amound of technical and design debt.
- **Product legitimacy:** Most importantly, user research uncovered doubts about the legitimacy of our white label products

<div class="subheader">Challenge</div>
### Build a design system that can eliminate technical and design debt. Make it suitable for fifteen of our clients' brands.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam dolor tellus, mattis at libero in, commodo efficitur lacus. Pellentesque porta rhoncus aliquet. Quisque ultricies eget nulla.

- **Make it very flexible**: the system would be used by three corporate sites, two B2B products, and two dozen different B2C booking engines
- **Help us kickstart redesign:** The creation of the design system would almost coincide with the redesign of our white label products and flagship B2B booking tools.
- **Democratize it:** my design philosophy led me to decide I wanted a design system to be accessible to designers, engineers, and other staff alike

<div class="subheader">Process</div>
### Analysis, architecture, and the nitty-gritty

<p class="bifold">Our designers and front-end engineers would become the primary users of this project. Since my design philosophy teaches me democratization and collaboration, we wanted to make it easy for non-technical colleagues to use it as well whenever they were brainstorming new features. Ut non tincidunt nulla. Curabitur sem enim, tincidunt a est quis, mattis consequat neque. Fusce quis tellus quis mi ultrices consectetur.</p>

#### UI inventory
Before I could begin making any type of choice, I made sure we had a good sense of where the problems lie. Pellentesque porta rhoncus aliquet. Quisque ultricies eget nulla eget suscipit. Integer a ligula erat. Proin vulputate ante libero, sit amet pretium nunc.

#### Identifying brand patterns

- **Alignment:** To what extent can the brand identities follow the same rhythm?
- **Topic**: WEtiam dolor tellus, mattis at libero in, commodo efficitur lacus.
- **Topic** Etiam dolor tellus, mattis at libero in, commodo efficitur eget nulla.

#### Picking a framework

- **Maintainability:** Giving Pattern Lab an initial spin, we soon learned Atomic Design only partially worked for us
- **Theming**: With its limited theming capacities at the time, Storybook.js didn't make the cut, even thought we loved it
- **Documentation** We placed a lot of value on the idea of centralized, democratized documentation available to everyone interested

<!-- Pattern Lab, Storybook (no theming at the time) -->
