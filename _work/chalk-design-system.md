###### A little context

### Airtrade offers a suite of consumer and enterprise travel technology products.

Over the course of twenty years, the company had established a strong name for itself with award-winning products, working with major players like KLM, Transavia, and D-reizen. 

Twenty years of software development (often sans designers), meant twenty years of choices, business rules, interaction patterns, color schemes, and code bases. 


#### Why we needed a design system

<div class="hero">
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>Debt</h5>
                <p class="mb-0">Across many years of iterations and changing teams, our product suite had built up sizeable technical and design debt</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>Productivity</h5>
                <p class="mb-0">Concepting, decision-making, hand offs... every part of the product cycle was complicated by our lack of structure</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>My role in this project</h5>
                <p class="mb-0">span.text-subtext</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="my-5">
        <div class="card text-bg-light">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5>My role</h5>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    <span class="text-strong">Working with an engineering lead, a product owner, and key business stakeholders,</span> I led this project, doing both front-end development and interface design. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
</div>

###### Challenge
### Build a design system that can eliminate technical and design debt. Make it suitable for 17 brand identities.

- **Flexibility is key**: the system would be used by four corporate sites, three B2B products, and two dozen different B2C booking engines
- **Help us kickstart redesign:** We had a few big projects on the horizon that required a better design system
almost coincide with the redesign of our white label products and flagship B2B booking tools.
- **Democratize it:** with the nature of our product development cycle, we needed a system that was easy to use for many types of non-designers

###### Analysis
### Comparing and contrasting UI libraries

Of the 17 brand identities we were looking to incorporate, 15 belonged to our clients. This meant 

<div class="hero">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <figure class="m-0 p-0">

                <figcaption>All the hard-coded declarations...</figcaption>
            </figure>

                <figcaption>Our CSS files were making incorrect use of color palettes</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>



#### Identifying brand patterns

- **Alignment:** To what extent can the brand identities follow the same rhythm?
- **Topic**: WEtiam dolor tellus, mattis at libero in, commodo efficitur lacus.
- **Topic** Etiam dolor tellus, mattis at libero in, commodo efficitur eget nulla.

<div class="hero">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <figure class="m-0 p-0">

                <figcaption>Using This Tool, I analysed the color schemes of our existing partners to get a sense of how well their brands might work together.</figcaption>

    </div>

#### Picking a framework

- **Maintainability:** Giving Pattern Lab an initial spin, we soon learned Atomic Design only partially worked for us
- **Theming**: With its limited theming capacities at the time, Storybook.js didn't make the cut, even thought we loved it
- **Documentation** We placed a lot of value on the idea of centralized, democratized documentation available to everyone interested

<!-- Pattern Lab, Storybook (no theming at the time) -->
