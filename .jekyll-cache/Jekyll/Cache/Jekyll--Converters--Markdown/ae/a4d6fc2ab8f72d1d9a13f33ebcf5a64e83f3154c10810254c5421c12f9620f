I"Á<p>This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. Youâ€™ll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts, rather than a portfolio of any kind. It is, for ever, in flux.</p>
