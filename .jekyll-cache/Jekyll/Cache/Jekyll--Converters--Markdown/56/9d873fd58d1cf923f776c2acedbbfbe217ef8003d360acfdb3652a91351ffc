<p>I’m currently taking a break from extracurricular activities, and so I currently don’t have space on my calendar for mentoring. Check out my <a class="internal-link" href="/mentoring">mentoring</a> page to learn more about my availability in the future.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-help-me-with-my-personal-brand--logo--website">Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?</h2>
<p>No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though: <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design">Fiverr</a> give most people what they need, and if you’re a one-person company you don’t need a logo.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-interview-you-for-my-podcast">Can I interview you for my podcast?</h2>
<p>Maybe! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. Send me an <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  About|email  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and I’ll let you know if I have time.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-write-something-for-me">Can you write something for me?</h2>
<p>Who knows! Email me about your request and let’s chat.</p>
