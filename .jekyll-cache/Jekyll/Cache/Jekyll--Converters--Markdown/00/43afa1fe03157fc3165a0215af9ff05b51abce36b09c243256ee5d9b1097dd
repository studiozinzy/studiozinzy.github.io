I"ì<p>A webring, one of the many artifacts of the early <a class="internal-link" href="/internet">Internet</a>, is a (sometimes thematic) set of websites that is organized as a chain, with each website pointing to a previous and a next website.</p>

<p>The beauty is the webring is that one can navigate the <a class="internal-link" href="/internet">Internet</a> without having to consult a search engine. Itâ€™s a public form of the cozy web that I quite enjoy.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pleased that webrings continue to be appreciated in certain corners of the web.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently part of these webrings:</p>
