<p>This website makes use of your browser-native typeface. This way, I don‚Äôt have to go down a typeface-buying rabbit hole every time I want to redesign my website, and you don‚Äôt have to wait for the page to load.</p>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p>While this website isn‚Äôt image-heavy, I did provide myself with various options for displaying imagery.</p>

<img src="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/web_first_images_release.png" />
<figcaption>In general, I use `<figure>`` to display full-width images, adding attribution if I've used a source.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

This is a personal website, designed, built, and maintained by me, Zinzy.

<label for="mn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle"> &#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">This is a margin note *without* a superscript </span>

### About this space
- This website is casual, unpretentious, and unassuming.
- On here, you'll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. 
- It's organized<label for="One" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="One" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum luctus lacus vitae nisi posuere, eget luctus turpis eleifend. Sed non purus magna. </span> as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts.
- This website lacks an archive or central index. Instead, it's a collection of linked files. I like that this is essentially a scavenger hunt.
- I use this website to participate in the IndieWeb, a great community of people who enjoy tinkering on personal websites, as well as independence while they do so.

<label for="mf-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-whatever" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/web_first_images_release.png" /><br />Sometimes, images are better in the sidebar.</span>

### Technical details
- This website is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a flat-file content management system I've been using for years. I like my familiarity with the platform, as well as the light-weight nature of flat-file systems.
- I've taken [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) digital garden template for Jekyll as my starting point. I continue to change it on an almost daily basis.
- The font you're looking at is whatever is native to your operating system.
- I've borrowed elements from [Clay Harmon](https://www.clayharmon.com/)'s [Tufte Jekyll theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll/tree/4bee109052ce50ac97f03efd41d4988a43f4a456) to achieve a particular style of sidenotes originating from the work of [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte).

### To do on this website
- Roam-style linking across content types `posts` and `notes`
