<p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Zinzy, welcome to my personal website. If youâ€™re interested in its design and technical details, read my <a class="internal-link" href="/colophon">Colophon</a>. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.</p>

<p>I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side. I live with <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">health challenges</a> that arenâ€™t chronic but persistent, and Iâ€™m slowly recovering.</p>

<p>I love reading, <a class="internal-link" href="/cooking">cooking</a>, embroidery, gardening, the cinema, Tanach and Bible study, learning languages, drawing, painting, exploring Amsterdam, biking, and finding quiet time to enjoy the small things in life. I also love:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a class="internal-link" href="/humanities">Humanities</a>:</strong> the fire that University lit has never really gone out. I enjoy reading academic research, and very much approach the world through the lens of cultural analysis.</li>
  <li><strong><a class="internal-link" href="/indieweb">IndieWeb</a></strong>: I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence of the Internet. I like tinkering with my own website, and visiting many others.</li>
  <li><strong>Gathering:</strong> as an amateur facilitator I love learning the art of bringing people together.</li>
  <li><strong><a class="internal-link" href="/music">Music</a>:</strong> a band geek as a child, I taught myself how to play most common wind instruments, as well as a few others. These days, I love writing my own songs and playing the guitar, which feels like a fifth limb. Iâ€™m saving up for a <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Public/_notes/Piano  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</li>
  <li><strong><a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">Yoga</a>:</strong> Iâ€™m a practitioner of various types of <a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">Yoga</a>. Iâ€™ve found they help me tremendously, both physically and emotionally. Iâ€™m currently exploring doing teacher training.</li>
