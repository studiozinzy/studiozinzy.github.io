I"D<p>This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. You’ll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts. I deliberately underplay the work I do, not because it is so spectacular, but because <mark>this space is not a portfolio</mark>.</p>

<p>There is no index or archive of its contents, so here are a few links to help you on your way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn more <a class="internal-link" href="/about">about</a> me</li>
  <li>Check out what I’m up to <a class="internal-link" href="/now">now</a></li>
  <li>Visit <a class="internal-link" href="/hello">hello</a> if you need to speak with me</li>
  <li>Continue browsing via <a class="internal-link" href="/collections">collections</a></li>
</ul>
