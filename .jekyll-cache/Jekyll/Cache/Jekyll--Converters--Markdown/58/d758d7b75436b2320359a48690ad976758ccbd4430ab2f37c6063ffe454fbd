<h3 id="thoughts-during-screening">Thoughts during screening</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dorothy‚Äôs posture is so dorky and clunky compared to Lorelei. There are a number of scenes where she is visibly designed to be less sexy (less cleavage etc). Even the dancing is different.</li>
  <li>Lorelei reminds me of <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Stepford Wives  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></li>
  <li>As though Marilyn‚Äôs lipsyncing to her own words</li>
  <li>Asking a million questions</li>
  <li>Brown kids in ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù hats? (Apparently North-African attire but it still looked messed up to me)</li>
  <li>Marilyn‚Äôs rendition of campy is so different from everyone else I almost feel uncomfortable using the term for both hers and the other performances. Either Marilyn is doing camp and everyone else is just acting, or everyone‚Äôs doing camp and Marilyn is‚Ä¶ what?</li>
  <li>Kort applaus!</li>
  <li>Diamonds = boobs</li>
  <li>Dancers faces obscured, focus on Marilyn</li>
  <li>Why was it okay for her hair to be so messy during ‚ÄúDiamonds‚Äù?</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs that made-for-tv movie with the courtroom bombshell again?</li>
  <li>Lorelei‚Äôs dance looks so odd on Dorothy</li>
</ul>
