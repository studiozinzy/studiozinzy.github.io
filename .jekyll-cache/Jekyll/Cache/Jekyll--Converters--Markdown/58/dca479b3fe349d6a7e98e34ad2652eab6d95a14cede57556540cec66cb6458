I"ß<p>In my professional capacity, I find myself among many people making a point to say that treating people like users is bad. Even outside of the design and product world there seems to be a growing understanding of how important it is for us to retain our sense of humanity as we travel the Internet. Itâ€™s 2022, and the average joe has at least some understanding of how expensive privacy, attention, and autonomy really are on the web.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-user">The anatomy of a user</h3>
<p>The growing body of product knowledge has the tendency to â€” unintentionally â€” establish unappetizing metaphors about users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User as a scenario</li>
  <li>User as a number</li>
  <li>User as an addict</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-thing">The right thing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding users helps us to the thing right, understanding people helps us do the right thing.</p>
