I"S<p>As a designer, I am very much not the first one to consider that treating people like users invokes unappetizing metaphors:</p>

  <li>The user as an addict: with a revenue model that requires boundless growth, design questions are aimed at detecting gaps in peopleâ€™s time and resource</li>
  <li>The user as a number</li>
</ul>
