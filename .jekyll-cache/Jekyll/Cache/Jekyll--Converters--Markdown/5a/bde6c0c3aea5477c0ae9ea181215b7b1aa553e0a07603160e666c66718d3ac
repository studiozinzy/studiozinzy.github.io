I"Š<p>Iâ€™ve been maintaining a single folder of plain text notes for about two decades now. Many of these notes are private. Some, however, make it into this public place, a digital garden of sorts. I let it be a place where mistakes can live, ideas can change, and where <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Question marks are more important than periods  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/diary">Diary</a></li>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a> page, which will tell you what Iâ€™m up to</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a>, about what Iâ€™m attending, reading, watching</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>, containing links of the websites I like</li>
</ul>
