I"2<p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by the recent feature film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just that: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently have been living in a kinder world as of recent. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Bredan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrel of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people how absolutely different life is for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>
