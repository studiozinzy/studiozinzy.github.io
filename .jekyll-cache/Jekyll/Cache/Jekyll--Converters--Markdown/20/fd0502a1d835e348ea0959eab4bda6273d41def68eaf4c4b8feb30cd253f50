I"<p>Today and tomorrow I’m attending <a href="uxinsight-festival-2022">UXinsight Festival 2022</a> and keeping notes. TIL that, for a brief moment in time in Tikrit, Iraq, there was a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_shoeing_incident">three-meter copper statue of a shoe that was thrown at George W Bush in 2008</a>. I’ve been working with these guys for over a year and a half now. It took me until today to realize they weren’t talking about “Kubernetics”. I’m curious to see how <a href="https://volse.net/~haraldei/">Harald</a> handles his website’s dark mode. Watching an <a href="https://youtu.be/PuAbCgGpeog">adorable documentary on early Internet culture</a>. Thinking about overconnectedness in the meantime. Signed the <a href="https://web0.small-web.org/#zinzy-waleson">Web0 manifesto</a>. Delighted to meet Elliott Cost at <a href="/niemeijer">Niemeijer</a>. I don’t often meet people in real life who are into personal web publishing. We discussed the value of writing hand-coded HTML pages with only CSS.</p>
