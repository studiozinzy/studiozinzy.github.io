I"¯<p>This page is part of Derek Siversâ€™ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now</a> movement. It contains a rough overview of what Iâ€™m up to or whatâ€™s top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where Iâ€™ve come from.</p>

  <li>Iâ€™m back at work <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>. After some time spent ruthlessly prioritizing my health, Iâ€™m excited to get my hands dirty again. Returning to <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Design  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> work feels like a warmth bath.</li>

  <li>Iâ€™m interested to read some of Germaine Greerâ€™s work. I like how, beyond the initial shock value of things she has said, there is a very blatant truth that Iâ€™m happy to engage with.</li>
  <li>After six weeks in the Algarve to continue recovering from an <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">Eating disorder</a>, Iâ€™m readjusting to bustling Amsterdam and establishing new <a class="internal-link" href="/habits">habits</a>.</li>
  <li>Before Portugal, I was notoriously rubbish at dreaming about what Iâ€™d want my life to be like. Iâ€™ve returned with a renewed sense of agency, and a small-but-growing <a class="internal-link" href="/bucket-list">bucket list</a> to boot.</li>
  <li>Getting settled it at my new <a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">yoga</a> studio Thrive Yoga.</li>

<h3 id="april-2022">April 2022</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. Weâ€™ve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>

<p>At Leeruniek, Iâ€™m focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. Itâ€™s great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. Weâ€™re also hiring in the product team and weâ€™ve already found a new engineer and a new designer. Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring our new team setup.</p>

<h3 id="september-2021">September 2021</h3>
<p>Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. Iâ€™m looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in <em>Youâ€™ve Got Mail</em>, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. Iâ€™m also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™m enjoying spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app, as well as CelinaSpookyBooâ€™s dad jokes and her accompanying laugh. Iâ€™ve been reading about chronic shame. Iâ€™ve been playing around with Gatsby starters for a bit, and Iâ€™m ready to begin building things from scratch.</p>
