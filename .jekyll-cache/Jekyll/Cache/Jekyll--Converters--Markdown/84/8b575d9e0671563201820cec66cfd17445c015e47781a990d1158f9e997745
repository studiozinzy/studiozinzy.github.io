<p>Iâ€™m a researcher, designer, and queer facilitator from <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Amsterdam  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, currently managing UX at <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Leeruniek  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. I specialize in building digital products for <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  People not users|#peoplenotusers  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> at work.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also a facilitator making resonant queer spaces in the city and on the Internet. Iâ€™m the founder and host of <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Queer Salon  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This is my website, a vastly personal project. It contains soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Put your feet up, stay a while. If you find anything that needs my attention, will you <a class="internal-link" href="/hello/">let me know</a>?</p>
