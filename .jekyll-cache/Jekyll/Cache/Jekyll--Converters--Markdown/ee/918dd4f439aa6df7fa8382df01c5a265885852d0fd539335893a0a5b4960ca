  <li>For a while, I worked as a fulltime tutor, zooming around Haarlem on my mountain bike</li>
  <li>I broke off a six-year relationship</li>
  <li>I moved from Haarlem to <a class="internal-link" href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a></li>
  <li>Began working my first fulltime office job at Airtrade</li>
</ul>
