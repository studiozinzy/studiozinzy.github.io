I"B<p>This is a personal website, designed, built, and maintained by <a class="internal-link" href="/about">yours truly</a>. In nature, it is casual, unpretentious, and unassuming.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This website is built in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a flat-file content management system I’ve been using for years. I like my familiarity with the platform, as well as the light-weight nature of flat-file systems.</li>
  <li>I’ve taken <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">Maxime Vaillancourt</a> digital garden template for Jekyll as my starting point. I continue to change it on an almost daily basis.</li>
  <li>The font you’re looking at is whatever is native to your operating system.</li>
</ul>
