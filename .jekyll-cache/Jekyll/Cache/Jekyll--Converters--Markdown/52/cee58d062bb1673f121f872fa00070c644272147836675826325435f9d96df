<p>Iâ€™m a researcher, designer, and queer facilitator from <a class="internal-link" href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, currently managing UX at <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>. I specialize in building digital products for <a class="internal-link" href="/people-not-users">#peoplenotusers</a> at work.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also a facilitator making resonant queer spaces in the city and on the Internet. Iâ€™m the founder and host of <a class="internal-link" href="/queer-salon">Queer Salon</a>, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This is my website, a vastly personal project. It contains soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Put your feet up, stay a while. If you find anything that needs my attention, will you <a class="internal-link" href="/hello/">let me know</a>?</p>
