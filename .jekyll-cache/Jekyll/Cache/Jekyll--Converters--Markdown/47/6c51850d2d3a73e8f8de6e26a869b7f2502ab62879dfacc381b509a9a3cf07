I"Ž<p>Iâ€™m glad you made it to my personal website. Itâ€™s a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and document and nurture my interests. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I taught myself to build websites when I was 10, and I havenâ€™t been the same since.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a queer Afropean person who is a nerd for the independent internet (which is where humans arenâ€™t products). Iâ€™m a musician, a cinephile, a writer, and an urbanite. I live with neurodiversity and a <a href="/tag/eating-disorder/">health condition</a>. In the Eastside of Amsterdam, my partner Anja and I share a wonderful shoebox.</p>

<p>With 16 years of experience making digital products, I sit at the intersection of research, design, and linguistics. Iâ€™m Design Manager at edtech scale-up Leeruniek, where we take a data-driven approach to more equitable primary education. Before this, I spent five years leading design at travel technology industry leader Airtrade. I was a very curious humanities major, studying <a href="https://www.uu.nl/bachelors/nederlandse-taal-en-cultuur">Dutch Language and Literature</a> and <a href="https://vu.nl/en/education/bachelor/theology-and-religious-studies">Theology</a> before graduating a decade ago.</p>
