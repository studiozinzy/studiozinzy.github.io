I"ð<p>Currently making my way through <em>Colloquial Yiddish</em>.</p>

<h3 id="unpolished-study-notes">Unpolished study notes</h3>

<p>Yiddish knows three main dialects as well as a formalized language:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Northeastern or Lithuanian Yiddish</li>
  <li>Central or Polish Yiddish</li>
  <li>Ukrainian Yiddisk</li>
  <li>Standard Yiddish originated in the 20th century, largely based on the pronunciation of Northeastern Yiddish, while retaining some pronunciation from the other two</li>
</ul>

<p>The Yiddish alphabet consists of the Hebrew letters already known to me, with a few notable differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The diacritic niqqud signs used both in Hebrew learning materials isnâ€™t used in Yiddish, aside from a number of signs used to distinguish between various pronunciations of the same letter. For me, itâ€™s more straightforward than the fairly intricate niqqud system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some notes on script and pronunciation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>yud</em> neighboring vowels is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code>, otherwise as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code></li>
  <li>Much like Hebrew, Yiddish uses a <em>shtumer alef</em> as a booster seat for vowels at the beginning of a work</li>
  <li><em>Chirek yud</em> helps distinguish between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> sounds, so that Yiddish can be spelled <em>×™×™×“×™×©</em>.</li>
</ul>
