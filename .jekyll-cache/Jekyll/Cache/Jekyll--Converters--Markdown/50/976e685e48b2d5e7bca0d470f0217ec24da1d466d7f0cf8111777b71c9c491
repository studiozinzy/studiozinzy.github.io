I"t<p>As a User Experience professional, I’m specialized in <a class="internal-link" href="/design">Design</a>ing tools that people use to solve problems at work. In the industry, we call this “enterprise UX”.</p>

<p>Enterprise software often comes with distinct challenges that I find interesting to work with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The person using a product is usually not the one buying it (or: employees are forced to use a product their employer deemed best)</li>
  <li>The contexts in which a product is used are specific and different from consumer apps</li>
  <li>Measuring the usability of enterprise software is often an intricate process that requires stamina</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to sell enterprise products</li>
  <li>The complex onboarding funnel requires close collaboration between UX and all other disciplines</li>
  <li>The product itself is often highly specialized and complex</li>
</ul>

<p>I got my start in enterprise UX at Airtrade, where I led design on a suite of travel booking and management products. At <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>, my focus is on educational technology.</p>
