I"d<p>As a former student of <a class="internal-link" href="/language">comparative literature</a>, and in particular the field of narratology, my tolerance for unnecessarily vague academic terms is bigger than average. Recently at our monthly dinner party, my father-in-law mentioned that he doesn’t think the term “narrative” is relevant in the majority of contexts. “In most cases, a simple ‘story’ will suffice”, he declared.</p>

<p>Recently, when I was publishing an old Now page, I came across a use case for the word “narrative” that did not allow for an interchanging of that word with “story”.</p>

<p>Here for posterity, as wel as for my father-in-law, is what I believe to be true about the word “narrative”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s relevant to refer to stories in an academic sense to honor the origins of the study of such artefacts: the Bulgarian-French scholar Tzvetan Todorov.</li>
  <li>“Narrative” in a non-academic sense can be helpful to distinguish between a story and a story that has a (slightly) more political or spin-like quality. Example: many people believe 10,000 steps a day is a healthy norm, when in reality this is a narrative spun by a <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/watch-your-step-why-the-10000-daily-goal-is-built-on-bad-science">Japanese pedometer brand from the 1960s</a>.</li>
</ol>
