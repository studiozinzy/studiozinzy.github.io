I"ó<h1 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h1>
<p>I reserve a portion of my time to remotely mentor designers and product managers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which Iâ€™m familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. Iâ€™ve been doing this since around 2012. When Iâ€™m not taking a break from mentoring, you may schedule time with me via <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a>.</p>
