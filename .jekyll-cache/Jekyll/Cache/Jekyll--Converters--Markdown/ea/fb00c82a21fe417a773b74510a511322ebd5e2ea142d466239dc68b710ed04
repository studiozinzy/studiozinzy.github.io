I"Š<p>In April 2020 I joined the leadership team of Vine &amp; Fig, an international online community for <a class="internal-link" href="/queerdom">queer</a> Catholics. I remember when I first found their website, hopeful and lonely about having begun to remember <a class="internal-link" href="/spirituality">how much the Catholic Church feels like home, despite every single thing</a>.</p>

<p>At Vine &amp; Fig, I was involved in social media for a while, and I facilitated live events. In the beginning of 2022 I pivoted away from social media, realizing how much itâ€™s begun to feel like work. Now, I only focus on facilitation and gathering.</p>
