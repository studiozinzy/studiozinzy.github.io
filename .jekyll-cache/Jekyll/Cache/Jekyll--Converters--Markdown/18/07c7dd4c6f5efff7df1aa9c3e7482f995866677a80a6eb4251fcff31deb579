I"+<p>Hey there, thank you for visiting my personal site! I’ve been using this space (and before it, others) to navigate the web since I was eleven years old. I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet (<a href="/colophon">read more about what that means for this website</a>). This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. You’ll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare.</p>
