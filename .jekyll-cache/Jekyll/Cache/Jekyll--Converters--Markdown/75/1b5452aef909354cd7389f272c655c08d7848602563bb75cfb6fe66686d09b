I"#<p>This page is part of Derek Sivers’ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now</a> movement. It contains a rough overview of what I’m up to or what’s top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where I’ve come from.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m back at work <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Leeruniek  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. After some time spent ruthlessly prioritizing my health, I’m excited to get my hands dirty again. Returning to <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Design  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> work feels like a warmth bath.</li>
  <li>Enjoying Amsterdam’s cultural opportunities by attending some fun events. Check my <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Consumption  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> page for details.</li>
  <li>I continue working hard to better manage my health (predominantly my <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Eating disorder  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>), which takes a lot of patience, faith, and guts.</li>
  <li>I’m invested in my <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Yoga  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Meditation  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> practice</li>
</ul>
