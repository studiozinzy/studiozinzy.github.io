I"7<p>Hey there, I’m Zinzy Waleson Geene. I’m pleased you made it to my personal website, a quiet street on the Internet. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.</p>

<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h3>
<p>I’m just this person, you know? Really, I’m a 35-year-old queer Afropean living and working in Amsterdam. First and foremost, I’m a nerd for the independent internet. I also love other things about which you may read on my <a class="internal-link" href="/my-interests">interests</a> page</p>

<p>I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side. I live with <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">health challenges</a> that aren’t chronic but persistent, and I’m slowly recovering. We’re considering welcoming a <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Dog  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> into our home.</p>
