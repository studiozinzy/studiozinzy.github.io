  <li>I’m employed as User Experience and Product Manager of Leeruniek, a wonderful scale-up in education technology.</li>
  <li>Regretfully, I’m exhausted, and on sick leave. Sleeping helps.</li>
  <li>I’m reading Nell Zink’s <em>The wallcreeper</em>, which is delightfully peculiar, and blessed with the, as <em>New Yorker</em>’s Kathryn Schulz put it beautifully, “unimprovable opening sentence— ‘I was looking at the map when Stephen swerved, hit the rock, and occasioned the miscarriage’.”</li>
