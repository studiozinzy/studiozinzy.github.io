I"Å<p>I like music: playing it, writing it, and listening to it.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-listen-to">What I listen to</h3>
<p>For years now I‚Äôve been using various methods to collect data on the music I play. Most of this data is stored in my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/zinzywaleson">LastFM account</a>. There was a time between 2008 and 2018 when I had varying ideas on online privacy, which has created a huge gap in my listening history. I continue to regret this.</p>
