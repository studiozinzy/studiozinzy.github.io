<p>Welcome to my home on the Internet. This website was hand-built by me, and I‚Äôm the only one publishing things on it. It contains facts about me and the work I do, but also working notes on some of my ideas, as well as short and longer diary entries. This is an example of a personal website.</p>

<p>Having my own website has many benefits, some you might not have thought of.</p>

<p>If I need to find a person, I google them. I don‚Äôt use social media, and I usually don‚Äôt enjoy having to log on to find who I‚Äôm looking for. When you own your own website, people don‚Äôt need to log back on to that no-longer-popular platform to find you.</p>

<p>When people Google me, the first thing they will see is a link to this website. On here, those interested can learn more about my work, and other things that are important to me.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-the-personal-website">The anatomy of the personal website</h3>
<p>A personal website is a web page or a cluster thereof showcasing anything the owner cares to share: examples of work, essays in blog form, snapshots, discovered links, whatever you can think of. It is the website version of the oft-seen Twitter bio ‚Äúviews are my own‚Äù.</p>

<p>Many people choose to segregate the personal information they share on a personal website. Some limit it to their work, others to their goings-on at home. Some use a single domain to share everything, like me.</p>
