  <li>Gorgeous shots</li>
  <li>Interesting auditory focalization (specifically the scene with DiMaggio where they seem to exist in a vacuum)</li>
  <li>Interesting use of lighting, particularly flood light style shots that are reminiscent of the later scenes in <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, and the constant flood of light celebrities must face</li>
  <li>Photographs that were turned into scenes were boring</li>
  <li>Why would Norma Jeane wear a full face of makeup including the beauty mark when she was “out of character”? That doesn’t seem like something she would do</li>
  <li>Shame Jane Russell didn’t appear in the <a class="internal-link" href="/gentlemen-prefer-blondes">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a> section</li>
  <li>Movie is an hour too long. Are they trying to convey importance with duration?</li>
  <li>I don’t know why I expected anything else than a depressing MeToo story</li>
  <li>The first Arthur Miller scene with the weird technicolor background seems entirely unnecessary</li>
  <li>What does the story want to say? That she was secretly a brilliantly deep actor?</li>
  <li>I wonder when women began calling their love interests “daddy”. I can’t imagine Marilyn originated this but I also wouldn’t put it past her.</li>
  <li>Whitey putting makeup on Marilyn’s face when she’s lying down is foreshadowing her death</li>
</ul>
