I"Œ<p>In my journey as a human with a personal computer, and more specifically as somebody who performs [[Knowledge work]], Iâ€™ve come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. When I consider using a particular app or platform, I pay close attention to how it will let me work with the things I create. This has helped me keep my writing organized since 2005.</p>
