I"•<p>The humanities comprises a group of academic fields that study humans, our culture, values, and artifacts with critical and analytical modes of inquiry.</p>

<p>As a student, I was trained in <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Dutch Language and Culture  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Theology  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-love-about-humanities">What I love about humanities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Asking questions about what a particular story means about a particular (sub)culture</li>
  <li>Looking at things that donâ€™t traditionally invite serious inquiry (such as <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Silly archives  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>)</li>
  <li>Asking questions about where one medium begins and the other ends, or what makes a medium what it is</li>
</ul>
