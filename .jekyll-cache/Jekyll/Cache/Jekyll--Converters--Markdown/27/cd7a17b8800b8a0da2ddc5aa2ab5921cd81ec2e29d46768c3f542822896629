I"<p>I’ve been a practitioner of yoga for about sixteen years now. These last few years I’ve begun concentrating on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Yin yoga</strong>, a slow-paced style of yoga that focuses on mild poses held for a longer period of time, which increases the practitioner’s focus on boundaries and stretching them. I love yin because its goal is not to let our bodies land in a pose, but rather to let the pose help us better land in our bbodies.</li>
  <li><strong>Yoga nidra</strong>,</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer an implementation of yoga that is provided by small-group, non-athletic, seemingly homely settings. For a while, I practised at Delight Yoga, which has a number of large spaces in the city. In recent times, I’ve come to enjoy Thrive Yoga, which is close to my house, and incredibly small.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-like-my-yoga">How I like my yoga</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slow pace</li>
  <li>Calm atmosphere</li>
  <li>A soundtrack made up of non-pop, low-lyric music</li>
  <li>Low number of participants</li>
</ul>
