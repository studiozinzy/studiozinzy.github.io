I"”<p>Since late 2020 Iâ€™ve been a part of the wonderful team of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology that was founded in 2015. I joined them because I liked what they told me</p>

<p>Leeruniek predominantly because I liked the things they told me about using data for good, and working autonomously in a design-forward product team.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-love-working-at-leeruniek">Why I love working at Leeruniek</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We operate from a standpoint of generous assumptions</li>
  <li>Employees are invited to be proactive and autonomous</li>
  <li>The product team is integrated, and tight-knit</li>
</ul>
