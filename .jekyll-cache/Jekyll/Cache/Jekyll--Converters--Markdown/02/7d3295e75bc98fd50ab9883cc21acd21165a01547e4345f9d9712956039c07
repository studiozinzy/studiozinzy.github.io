<p>Introduced by Michael Bungay Stanier, the seven questions can help people, particularly those in leadership positions, become better at helping others.</p>

<h2 id="seven-questions">Seven questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What’s on your mind? ^a2fe76</li>
  <li>And what else?</li>
  <li>What’s the real challenge here for you?</li>
  <li>What do you want?</li>
  <li>How can I help?</li>
  <li>If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?</li>
  <li>What was most useful for you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I first learned about this concept while listening to <a href="https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-with-michael-bungay-stanier-on-the-advice-trap-and-staying-curious-just-a-little-longer/"><em>Dare to Lead</em>’s episode on the advice trap</a>.</p>
