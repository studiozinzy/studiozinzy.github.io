I"•<p>In many ways, <a class="internal-link" href="/2015">2015</a> was a transformative year for me.</p>

<p>I like to think the genre dominating 2015â€™s playlist is far from my regular taste in music. After all, most of the songs found a permanent spot in my brain because they were on repeat at the bars I used to frequent. But who am I kidding, I am what I am, and in 2015, I was drunk.</p>

<p>When I listen to these songs, vivid memories nudge my senses. I smell a girl I had a terrible crush on, feel how awfully tired I was all the time, taste the cigarettes and beer on my breath.</p>

<p>Everything was uncertain and thrilling, and every fiber in me was yearning yearning yearning for whatever was perpetually out of reach.</p>

<p>Looking back, it was a rough time in my life. At the same time, Iâ€™m quite thankful to have such strong memories of the period that can be activated by a simple song, even if itâ€™s just for the knowledge that music can achieve such a thing.</p>
