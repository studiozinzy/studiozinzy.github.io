I"<h1 id="opinions">Opinions</h1>
<p>Inspired by the good <a href="https://elliott.computer/pages/opinion/">Elliott Cost</a> I maintain a page of opinions I have. They’re subject to change.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carnations are the best flowers</li>
  <li>Growing plants is more fun when the plants are small</li>
  <li>People in their early- to mid-thirties should have access to Pokémon Red on a floppy disk, as well as a deviceon which to play it</li>
  <li>Ironing is a calming activity</li>
  <li>Neon candles are usually the most beautiful candles</li>
  <li>Seeing yourself in other people is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self</li>
  <li>White isn’t a color unless it’s a skin color</li>
  <li>The fact that murder is punished more harshly than inflicting deep, complex trauma upon a person is odd, because it implies that the grief people might feel about your death is more important than you grieving the life you could’ve had if you hadn’t been traumatized</li>
  <li>In its most rudimentary form, Twitter would be a list of opinions taking the form of a microblog. No following, no followers.</li>
  <li><em>Halloween</em> is the best horror movie franchise, in the very first place because of the blatant disregard the films have for one another.</li>
</ul>
