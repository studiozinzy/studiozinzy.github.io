I"³<p>As a designer, I am very much not the first one to consider that treating people like users invokes unappetizing metaphors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The user as an addict:</strong> with a revenue model that requires boundless growth, design questions are aimed at detecting gaps</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>in peopleâ€™s time and resources, and identifying which gaps can be filled by a product</li>
  <li>The user as a number</li>
</ul>
