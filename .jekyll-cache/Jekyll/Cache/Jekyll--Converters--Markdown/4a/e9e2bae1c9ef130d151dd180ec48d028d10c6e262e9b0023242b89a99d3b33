<p>I keep a casual collection of unfinished thoughts; random snippets on a myriad of topics. Soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Currently, there are <strong>65 notes</strong> on the garden. Iâ€™ve set up my garden as a scavenger hunt, so there is no permanent archive.</p>
