<p>I share a little shoebox on the <a class="internal-link" href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> East side with Anja, who is, and Iâ€™m biased, dynamite. I enjoy learning the love language of cooking, urban gardening, embroidery, and making music. I have a penchant for shameless reality television, Barbra Streisand music, and monster disaster movies. Iâ€™m a practitioner of unguided meditation.</p>
