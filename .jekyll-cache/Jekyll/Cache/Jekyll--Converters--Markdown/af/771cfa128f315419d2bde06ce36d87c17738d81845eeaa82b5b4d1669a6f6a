I"Æ<p>In the name of destigmatization of health issues I decided a while ago that I was going to use this website to write about what it means to have an eating disorder. This page chronicles some of the experiences I have as I go through recovery.</p>

<h3 id="meet-my-eating-disorder">Meet my eating disorder</h3>
<p>My eating disorder has developed in response to a number of (untreated) adverse childhood experiences, which left me feeling powerless, unsafe, and unimportant. The first eating disordered act I remember was at age seven, but really there is no time ‚Äúbefore my eating disorder‚Äù. The first time I knew I had an eating disorder was in my early teens.</p>

<p>Or rather than ‚Äúknew‚Äù I ‚Äúwanted‚Äù one.</p>

<p>With the rise of Web 2.0, I fell into a deep hole of pro-ana Xanga blogs that showed me that having an eating disorder was glamorous, effective, and hip. A close friend and I would get together and ‚Äúfake‚Äù having an eating disorder by carrying out associated behaviors. Things I now know to be life-threatening, and detrimental to anyone‚Äôs long-term mental health. At home, certainly dictated by <a class="internal-link" href="/diet-culture">Diet culture</a>, my Food Rule Book began growing and growing.</p>

<p>Despite the signs, my eating disorder remained untreated.</p>

<p>Somehow, in my late teens, I managed to pivot. I began telling myself that what I had been doing was terrible, that I deserved more. I moved away for university, and began taking care of my own mini household, which, with all the laundry, and the studying, and the cleaning, and the cooking, I found rather overwhelming. My Food Rule Book became a safe haven, just now with different rules.</p>
