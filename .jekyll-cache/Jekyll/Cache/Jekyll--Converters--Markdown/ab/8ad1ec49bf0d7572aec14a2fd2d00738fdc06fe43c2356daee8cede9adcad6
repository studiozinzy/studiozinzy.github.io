I"s<p>Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesn’t land me in a FOMO-inducing Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. It’s another one of the <a class="internal-link" href="/habits">Habits</a> I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. It’s pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered.</p>

<p>It’s also one of the few moments of solitude and focus I allow myself this week, apparently. Now that I’m beginning to reintegrate back into work at <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>, I seem to have forgotten how much down time my body still requires. I’ve received a work assignment, on which I’ll get to work independently, and I’m excited. Curious. Hungry. On the cusp of small-scale overdrive. I had to stop working precisely because of this.</p>

<p>It’s boring.</p>

<h3 id="whats-top-of-mind-right-now">What’s top of mind right now</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Saw Hannah Gadsby’s <a class="internal-link" href="/body-of-work">Body of Work</a> and had a brief, cogent crush on her</li>
  <li>Saw a large number of Twitter folks join the much kinder Mastodon club. I’m slowly beginning to feel comfortable about the platform, and how it invites me to share my thoughts.</li>
  <li>I’m thinking a lot about what ex-Twitter designer <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@jon@social.lot23.com/109372263710282940">Jon Bell</a> said about Twitter’s user experience trajectory. I keep saying out loud how central the difference between <a class="internal-link" href="/do-the-right-thing">doing the right thing</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/do-the-thing-right">doing the thing right</a> is to the design work I do.</li>
