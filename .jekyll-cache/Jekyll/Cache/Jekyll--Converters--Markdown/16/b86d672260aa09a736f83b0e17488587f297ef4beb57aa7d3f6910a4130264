I"†<p>Welcome to my working notes. I write in public about what has my interest. Notes usually start out small (or empty), and grow as I do. The notes are densely linked, unfinished, possibly incorrect, and always ready for improvement. Any note that starts with an asterisk <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>, know that itâ€™s an evergreen that Iâ€™m tending to.</p>
