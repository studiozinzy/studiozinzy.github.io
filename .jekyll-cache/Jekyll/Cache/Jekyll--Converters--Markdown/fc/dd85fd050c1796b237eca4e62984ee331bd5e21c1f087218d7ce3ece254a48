<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  &lt;h3 class="mb-3"&gt;I’m a learner and sometimes I make things about what I learn. Since I was a child, the Internet has been a medium I use to do so.&lt;/h3&gt;   
  &lt;p&gt;I'm a Santomean-Dutch queer person who grew up in the Dutch South. These days, home is Amsterdam. There, in its finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I share a shoebox with Anja, and soon also puppy Lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In my spare time I like to make music, swim, write, cook, read short stories and comics, enjoy the city, and explore cinema. I like to teach myself new things, and currently I’m diving head-first into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWu9VxVQ6Lg&amp;ab_channel=IgnasMaknickas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;minimalist compositions for the piano&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="mt-5 mb-3"&gt;For 16 years I’ve had the pleasure of making a wild variety of things for the Internet.&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Drawing from training in research, linguistics, literature, and — yes — theology, I current work as a Design Manager at edtech scale-up &lt;a href="https://leeruniek.nl"&gt;Leeruniek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I love dreaming big and working small to improve habits, teams, products, and services. Being a catalyst for better collaboration and design thinking is possibly my favorite thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I’m glad you made it to my personal website. It’s a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.</p>
