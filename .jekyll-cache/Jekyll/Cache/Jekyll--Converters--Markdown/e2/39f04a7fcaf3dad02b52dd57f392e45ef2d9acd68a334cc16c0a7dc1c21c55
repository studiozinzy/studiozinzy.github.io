I"9<p>I’m Zinzy, a person living and working in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.</p>

<p>I’m a researcher and designer making tools for people at work, a facilitator making resonant queer spaces, and a humble linguist who enjoys the art of writing.</p>

<p>This website is a vastly personal project.</p>

<hr />

<p>Central to this website is a growing collection of undated notes that are perpetually subject to change. Currently, there are <span>94</span> notes. There is no index or archive or these notes. Instead, I invite you to start here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a> page will tell you what I’m up to</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a> is all about what I’m attending, reading, watching</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> contains links of the websites I like</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/about">About</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/hello">Hello</a>, or <a class="internal-link" href="/contact">Contact</a>.</li>
</ul>
