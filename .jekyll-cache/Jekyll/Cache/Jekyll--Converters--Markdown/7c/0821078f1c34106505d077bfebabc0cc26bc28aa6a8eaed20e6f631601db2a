I"Ö<p>Hello, Iâ€™m Zinzy, and I enjoy meeting new people. If thereâ€™s any reason you think you and I should be talking, please feel free to reach out.</p>

<p>The answer youâ€™re looking for might be on the <a class="internal-link" href="/faq">faq</a> page.</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is by sending me an email. If you attach my first name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@pm.me</code>, itâ€™ll find its way to my inbox.</p>

<p>Get in touch if youâ€™d like to work or learn together, have something to share, or want to say hi. If you would like to be notified when there are new posts on this site,Â <a href="http://eepurl.com/gH9of1">sign up</a>Â to receive a weekly or monthly email digest.</p>

<p>If your inquiry is related to marketing (guest posts, backlink requests, sponsored content, etc.), please see myÂ <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/details/">policies</a>. TL;DR version: I donâ€™t generally do that stuff, this is a personal site.</p>
