<p>I’m glad you made it to my personal website. It’s a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and nurture my interests.</p>

<p>I’m Zinzy, a Santomean-Dutch queer person who grew up in the Dutch South. These days, home is Amsterdam. There, in its finest neighborhood, I share a shoebox with <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/anjawaleson/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">Anja</a> (and soon also a puppy).</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to make music, swim, write, cook, enjoy the city, and explore cinema. I like to teach myself new things, and currently I’m diving head-first into the piano.</p>

<h3 id="about-my-work">About my work</h3>
<p>For 16 years, I’ve been making a living by building digital products. Drawing from training in research, linguistics, literature, and — yes — theology, I current work as a Design Manager at edtech scale-up <a href="https://leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>.</p>

<p>I love dreaming big and working small to improve habits, teams, products, and services. Being a catalyst for better collaboration and design thinking is possibly my favorite thing in the world.</p>
