I"„<p>My name is Zinzy Waleson Geene, and this is my personal site. Iâ€™m a researcher, designer, and facilitator.</p>

<p>Heya, Iâ€™m pleased you made it to my personal website. Iâ€™m Zinzy Waleson Geene, and this is a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and document and nurture my interests.</p>

<p>The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative.</p>

<h3 id="in-life">In life</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m a queer Afropean person who is a nerd for the independent internet (which is where humans arenâ€™t products). Iâ€™m a musician, a cinephile, a writer, and an urbanite. In the Eastside of Amsterdam, my partner Anja and I share a wonderful shoebox.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m a generalist with thorough experience solving problems where research, design, systems, and strategy meet. Right now I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at Leeruniek. I have sixteen years of professional experience making digital products. Before this, I lead design at Airtrade for five years. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years.</p>
