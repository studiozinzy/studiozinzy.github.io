I"ç<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m Zinzy, a person living and working in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a researcher and designer making tools for people at work, a facilitator making resonant queer spaces, and a humble linguist who enjoys the art of writing.</p>

<p>This website is a vastly personal project.</p>
