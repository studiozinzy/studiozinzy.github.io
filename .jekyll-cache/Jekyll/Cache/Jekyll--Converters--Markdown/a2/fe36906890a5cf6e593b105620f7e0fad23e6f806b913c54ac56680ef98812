I"B<p>Since late 2020 I’ve been a part of the wonderful team of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology that was founded in 2015. I joined them because I liked what they told me about using data for good, about equity in education, and about working autonomously in a design-forward product team.</p>

<p>Together, we’re on a path to sustainable and more equitable use of educational data.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-do-there">What I do there</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The product team is my launching pad for how I roam the company. I’m primarily concerned with anything to do with user experience: from research-informed large-scale decisions to the details of our design system.</li>
  <li>Outside of the product team I advocate for the people working with our company by coaching non-UX staff in user-centered thinking, and by giving them concrete tools to get the answers they need.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-i-love-working-at-leeruniek">Why I love working at Leeruniek</h2>
<p>If you’re considering joining us, here are some honest opinions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We operate from a standpoint of generous assumptions and curiosify</li>
  <li>Employees are invited to be proactive and autonomous</li>
  <li>The product team is integrated, and tight-knit</li>
  <li>Our company culture is soft and friendly</li>
</ul>
