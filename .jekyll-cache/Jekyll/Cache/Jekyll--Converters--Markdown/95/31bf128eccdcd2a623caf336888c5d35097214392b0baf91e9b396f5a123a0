  <li>Reading Zadie Smith’s <em>On Beauty</em>, enjoying it so far</li>
  <li>Building a sustainable meditation practice by engaging in daily unguided sessions (which, as it turns out, is a lot more relaxing than finding the perfect guided meditation on the perfect app)</li>
  <li>Training my product management muscle by having difficult internal conversations about priorities</li>
  <li>Thoroughly enjoying mentoring on ADPList.</li>
</ul>
