I"n'<p>Now that we’ve reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What made 2022 different isn’t its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted.</p>

<p>My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was experiencing or facing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey that took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at <a href="https://humanconcern.nl/">Human Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022, as well as some random photographs that I took this year and loved.</p>

<h3 id="i-finally-found-a-way-to-connect-with-that-intuition-everybody-has-been-raving-about">I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about.</h3>
<p>I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously slowing and simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what’s difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. Entering into that conversation, I’ve become better at noticing what effect everyday life has on me: the “rebound”, as we call it in yin yoga.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-flaw-that-neurodiversity-isnt">The design flaw that neurodiversity isn’t</h3>
<p>Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber who has shown me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sS00egAzg">how I can better organize things and, well, <em>do</em> them</a>. All of my life, I’ve been known to learn quickly, think originally, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I’m writing this, I’m already playing a pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago, but I can’t sustain a simple tidying routine to save my life.)</p>

<p>I was never unaware of what this meant or what it’s called, but what I never <em>got</em> was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency. That I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn’t stop trying until I could build habits like everyone else. I’ve never heard Elizabeth use the word “neurodiversity”, but it’s refreshing to hear from someone in whom I can see myself. Thanks to what I learned from her, I spent a good portion of 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, optimizing for passion rather than consistency.</p>

<h3 id="it-may-be-valuable-to-jumpstart-a-connection-by-oversharing-but-usually-it-isnt">It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn’t.</h3>
<p>In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs. Outside of these relationships, though, 2022 showed me the value of pacing myself, friendship-wise. New people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can’t always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-worthwhile-stories">Surround yourself with worthwhile stories</h3>
<p>I’ve given up on the need to be a reader. I have a strong confirmation bias for the idea that I don’t read enough to justify the literature degree I have. Because of it, I see people basking in the light of the books they’re reading everywhere I go. Six weeks in the Algarve with no books except the Bible I didn’t touch did wonders for me. Instead of my usual feelings of guilt, I’m more discerning about the stories with which I surround myself. Life is too short to spend it feeding my brain and soul with things that don’t make me feel better, more excited, and more curious about life. This made it easy to skip <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_(TV_series)#Reception">Them</a></em>,  <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html">The Whale</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing">Where the Crawdads Sing</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="firstly-im-a-designer">Firstly, I’m a designer</h3>
<p>In 2022 I realized that I don’t want to be a Product Manager. Since 2021 I’d been dabbling in the field, combining it with Design Management at my place of work, Leeruniek. Working as a Product Manager taught me volumes on strategic decision-making, big-picture thinking, and motivating an entire company behind a roadmap. It made me stellar at knowledge work. Sadly, it didn’t leave me enough room to do the things I truly love: product research and design, and the operational and leadership aspects associated with them. After my extended sick leave, I’m reintegrating back at work, thoroughly enjoying the researcher and designer I once again have become.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-i-learned">Other things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food is cool, but I must chill:</strong> with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for well over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. The lesson is that weeknight dishes don’t have to take longer than an hour to prepare. I’ve committed to this with varying degrees of success.</li>
  <li><strong>Dogs aren’t so bad after all:</strong> if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I’m known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he’s “suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”, and I’ve always proudly countered that with “don’t trust people who are suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”. That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.</li>
