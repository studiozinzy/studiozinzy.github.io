I"Ž<p>Iâ€™m Zinzy Waleson, a Dutch Afropean person living and working in Amsterdam. I enjoy the art of personal web publishing. This website contains working notes on a variety of topics, as well as casual updates on whatâ€™s keeping me busy.</p>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<p>I share a little shoebox on the Amsterdam East side with Anja, who is, and Iâ€™m biased, dynamite. I enjoy learning the love language of cooking, urban gardening, embroidery, and making music. I have a penchant for shameless reality television, Barbra Streisand music, and monster disaster movies.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Although Iâ€™m currently on sick leave, I manage User Experience and Product at Leeruniek, a scale-up in education technology.</p>
