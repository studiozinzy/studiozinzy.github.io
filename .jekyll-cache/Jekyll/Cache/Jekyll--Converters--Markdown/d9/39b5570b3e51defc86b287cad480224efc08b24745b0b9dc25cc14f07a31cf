I"/<p>I’m Zinzy Waleson, a person on the Internet. I taught myself how to build websites when I was eleven, and I’ve been using this skill to navigate the web ever since. I enjoy using [[IndieWeb]] principles to design the experiences I have online. Much of this website is dedicated to just that.</p>
