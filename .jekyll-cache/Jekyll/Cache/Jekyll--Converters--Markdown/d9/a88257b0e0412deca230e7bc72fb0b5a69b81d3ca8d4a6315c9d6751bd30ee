I"ã<p>This is a personal website, designed, built, and maintained by <a class="internal-link" href="/about">me, Zinzy Waleson Geene</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-details">Technical details</h3>
<p>A full overview of the technical implementation of this website can be found in my <a href="/humans.txt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">humans.txt</code> file</a>.</p>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, everything on this website is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>, which means: share (and change) my work but say itâ€™s mine, donâ€™t use it for profit, and use the same license.</p>

<h3 id="philosophical">Philosophical</h3>
<p>This website is a vastly personal project. It contains soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I use this website to participate in the <a class="internal-link" href="/indieweb">IndieWeb</a>. I believe in <a class="internal-link" href="/thinking-in-public">Thinking in public</a>, and having it be an act of <a class="internal-link" href="/anti-marketing">Anti-marketing</a>. This space isnâ€™t allowed to pressure me to be smart, funny, insightful or anything else that I am not on a permanent basis. I donâ€™t pretend to be involved in current events, and because of that you may find me discover things youâ€™ve known about for ages already.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>On this website, I mostly share two types of content: dated posts, sorted chronically in a <a class="internal-link" href="/Blog/">blog</a>, and my <a class="internal-link" href="/Notes/">working notes</a>, which are updated frequently as I learn and develop my unfinished thoughts. If you spot anything that you think is wrong, <a class="internal-link" href="/hello">let me know</a>.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>This website is a text-mostly website, meaning it is designed to focus on the written word. I hope it provides a comfortable reading experience regardless of the screen you have. Thereâ€™s a color theme for light mode, as well as dark mode. Iâ€™m in the process of making my website fully accessible.</p>
