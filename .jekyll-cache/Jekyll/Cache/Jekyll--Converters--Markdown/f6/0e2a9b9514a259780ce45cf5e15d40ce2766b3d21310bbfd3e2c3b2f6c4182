I"@<p>Below you’ll find incomplete thoughts on why I design the way I design.</p>

<p>In my professional capacity, I am one among many people stating that treating people like users is bad. Even outside of the design and product world there seems to be a growing understanding of how expensive privacy, attention, and autonomy really are on the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-user">The anatomy of a user</h3>
<p>The growing body of knowledgenappetizing metaphors</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The user as an addict:</strong> with a revenue model that requires boundless growth, design decisions seemingly neglect to ask whether increased engagement with a product is effective in one’s grander scheme of things</li>
  <li><strong>The user as a number:</strong> as our abilities to incorporate quantitative user and product research into our decision-making grows, it’s tempting to favor these methods over qualitative methods, particularly when a design department isn’t sufficiently organized</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-thing">The right thing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding users helps us to the thing right, understanding people helps us do the right thing.</p>
