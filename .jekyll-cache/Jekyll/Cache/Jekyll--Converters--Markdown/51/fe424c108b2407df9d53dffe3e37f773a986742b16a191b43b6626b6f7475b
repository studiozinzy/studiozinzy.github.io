I"Ä<p><a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109698329736256912">As I already mentioned earlier today on Mastodon</a>, one of my favorite things about design work is getting to help other designers solve their own problems.</p>

<p>Today, as one of the designers on my team and I were discussing how to leverage research to benefit stakeholder relationships, I saw a light switch on in her head that I think weâ€™d have trouble turning off if we even wanted to. Itâ€™s so satisfying to see that happen, simply by mentioning a framework, or sharing a little bit of background on a particular research method, or on the research process.</p>

<p>Coming back from product management into design management lets me focus wholeheartedly on this part of my skillset. Iâ€™m still not fully back at work (doing five hours a day now), but with encounters like this Iâ€™m beginning to feel more and more a part of the team again.</p>

<p>And I wouldnâ€™t want it any other way.</p>
