I"<p>I’ve been maintaining a single folder of plain text notes for about two decades now. Many of these notes are private. Some, however, make it into this public place, a digital garden of sorts. I let it be a place where mistakes can live, <a class="internal-link" href="/ideas-can-change">Ideas can change</a>, and where questions are more important than answers.</p>

<p>As an act of <a class="internal-link" href="/antiperformativity">antiperformativity</a>, although I believe that, on the Internet very little of the sort can exist, I write these notes for me, not for you. Because of this, there is no index. R</p>

<ul>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/diary">Diary</a></li>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a> page, which will tell you what I’m up to</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a>, about what I’m attending, reading, watching</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>, containing links of the websites I like</li>
</ul>
