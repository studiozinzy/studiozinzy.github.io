I"À<p>Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesnâ€™t land me in a personalized Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. Itâ€™s a [[habits]] I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. Itâ€™s pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered.</p>
