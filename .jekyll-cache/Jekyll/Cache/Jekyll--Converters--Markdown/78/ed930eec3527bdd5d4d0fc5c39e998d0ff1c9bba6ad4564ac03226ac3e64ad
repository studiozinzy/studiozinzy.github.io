I"$<p>Hello, I’m <a class="internal-link" href="/about">Zinzy Waleson</a>!</p>

<p>I love the intersection of design, research, and strategy, and I also love cooking, making music, yoga, reading, and cinema.</p>

<p>I enjoy meeting new people. If you have something to share, you’d like to play or learn together, or can think of any othe reason we should be talking, get in touch with me. This is my <a href="https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/">hello</a> page, where you can learn how I like to keep in touch.</p>

<p>How to contact me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For any inquiry, email is your best shot. Please use my <a class="internal-link" href="/contact">contact form</a>.</li>
  <li>I infrequently check <a href="https://mstdn.social/@zinzy">Mastodon</a> because I like things that are decentralized.</li>
  <li>If you’d like to schedule mentor time with me, check my <a class="internal-link" href="/mentoring">mentoring</a> page (I’m currently on hiatus from it)</li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not use social media. Any account in my name that you may find is not in use, so feel safe to assume I won’t see your message, and I won’t receive a notification of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I don’t use any other social media beyond the above, except in <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> rare cases when I’m otherwise unable to find a way to communicate with someone I’m needing to contact. If you find any account in my name on a social media platform, you can assume I won’t ever see messages sent to it, and I won’t be notified of mentions/interactions with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of your answers might be found on my <a class="internal-link" href="/faq">faq</a> page.</p>
