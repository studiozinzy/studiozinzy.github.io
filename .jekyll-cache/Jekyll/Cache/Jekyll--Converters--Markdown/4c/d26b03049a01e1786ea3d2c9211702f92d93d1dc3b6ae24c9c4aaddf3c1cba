I"D<p>Heardle is a browser-based <a class="internal-link" href="/music">Music</a> game the setup of which was derived from the immensely popular game <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Wordle  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. Every day, Heardle allots the user six attempts to guess a song. It starts out as a short fragment, and seconds are added with each missed guess. After six guesses, the full song will play.</p>

<p>The tagline of <a href="https://heardle.app">Heardle</a> should be: “wow, though, music, huh?” I was introduced to Heardle by A, who got it from The Roxane Gay Agenda. I’ve been playing Heardle since the day I met it. I currently hold a 75% success rate. I’m not strong on pop music from the past five years.</p>

<p>Heardle isn’t so much a game as it is an ode to music. Not music that has been produced, but the very concept: that there are sequences of sound that are so familiar to us that we recognize them even if the sound lasts a second.</p>
