I"½<p>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never feel like there is a style that suits me. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet to compare, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.</p>

<p>Finished <em>The Midnight Library</em>, which Iâ€™ve found to be a great kickstarter to my reading habit.</p>
