<p>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, Iâ€™m having trouble understanding whether Iâ€™m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether Iâ€™ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.</p>
