I"â<p>Heya, Iâ€™m pleased you made it to my personal website. Itâ€™s a quiet street on the Internet where I come to link and think. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative. I come here to learn in public, change my mind, and document and nurture my interests.</p>

<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m a 35-year-old queer Afropean person who is a nerd for the independent internet (which is where humans arenâ€™t products). Iâ€™m an amateur writer and musician, a home cook, a cinephile, and an urbanite. I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants on the Amsterdam East side.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m a generalist with thorough experience solving problems where research, design, systems, and strategy meet. Right now I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Leeruniek  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. I have sixteen years of professional experience making digital products. Before this, I lead design at Airtrade for five years. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years.</p>
