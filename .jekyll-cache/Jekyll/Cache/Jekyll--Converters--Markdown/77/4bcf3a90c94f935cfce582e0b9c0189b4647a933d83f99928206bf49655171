I"F<p>I’ve been a practitioner of yoga for about sixteen years now. These last few years I’ve begun concentrating on yin yoga and nidra yoga. I prefer an implementation of yoga that is provided by small-group, non-athletic, seemingly homely settings. For a while, I practised at Delight Yoga, which has a number of large spaces in the city. In recent times, I’ve come to enjoy Thrive Yoga, which is close to my house, and incredibly small.</p>
