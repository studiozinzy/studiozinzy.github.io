I"Ì<p>For the past year and a half Iâ€™ve been on a journey to take better care of myself. Part of this journey has been (re)defining what habits mean, to me. With a plethora of books, podcasts, videos, and apps dedicated to helping the audience develop better habits, I felt like I had lost any connection I had to the word. The quantified and often competitive nature of such platforms had me focus on extrinsic (seeing a green checkmark or a visualization of a streak) rather than intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>I incorporate meditation into my life where I can, alternating unguided meditation and guided meditation with my favorite app. Lately, Iâ€™ve been playing around with the Marina Abramovic Method, which isnâ€™t so much a straight-forward meditation technique as it is something that sits in between meditating and playing.</p>
