I"<p>Brutalist web design is a style of websites that was inspired by brutalist architecture. It often features content presented in browser-native styling, with few alterations.</p>

<p>Many websites may employ the style, although it should be noted that a large number of websites that look brutalist were created and designed long before the style emerged.</p>

<p>David Bryant Copeland proposed the following principles for brutalist web design:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices</li>
  <li>Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks</li>
  <li>Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons</li>
  <li>The back button works as expected</li>
  <li>View content by scrolling</li>
  <li>Decoration when needed and no unrelated content</li>
  <li>Performance is a feature</li>
</ol>
