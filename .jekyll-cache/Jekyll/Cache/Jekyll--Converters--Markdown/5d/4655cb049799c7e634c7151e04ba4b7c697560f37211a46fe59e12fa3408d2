I"O<p>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never feel like there is a style that suits me. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet for comparison, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.</p>
