<p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Zinzy, welcome to my personal website. This page will tell you about who I am in life. If youâ€™re interested in learning more about my work in UX, <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Portfolio|check out my portfolio  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-background">A little background</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands and have been in <a class="internal-link" href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> since 2015, where I share a shoebox with my partner A and our plants.</p>

<p>I have a penchant for reading and writing, and Iâ€™ve been doing the latter since the mid nineties, both online and offline.</p>

<p>I came to <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Utrecht  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> to study the letters. Living there, I loved the endless opportunities that academic life provides. I ran an absurdist literary magazine, worked as a research assistant, and I learned to ask critical questions. I also began running Studio Zinzy, a one-person design and development practice.</p>

<p>I earned my undergraduate degree in <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Dutch Language and Culture  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> with a special interest in narratology, comparative literature, intermediality, and sociolinguistics. Before I joined the UX workforce fulltime, I spent a year in seminary studying <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Theology  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> to become a minister. It wasâ€¦ an experience.</p>

<p>Outside of work I moonlight as a queer facilitator. Currently, Iâ€™m on the leadership team of <a class="internal-link" href="/vine-fig">Vine &amp; Fig</a>, and Iâ€™m the founder and host of <a class="internal-link" href="/queer-salon">Queer Salon</a>.</p>
