I"<p>I’m using this file to chronicle the emotions I experience having a <a class="internal-link" href="/brutalist-web-design">Brutalist web design</a> for this website.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2022-11-23: I’m looking forward to send <a class="internal-link" href="/why-i-have-a-website">Why I have a website</a> to my friend who should make a website. What if she thinks mine is too ugly?</li>
  <li>2022-11-23: people have told me they like my website. What if they return and now think it’s ugly?</li>
  <li>2022-11-26: I’ve reached a huge milestone with the setup of this website, and I felt weird about having an old-fashioned <a class="internal-link" href="/internet">Internet</a> vibe to it. Built 80% of a new design that was more modern-looking and deleted it because I got lazy.</li>
</ul>
