<p>In order to achieve a well-balanced color scheme, Erica Schoonmaker introduced her <a class="internal-link" href="/design">Design</a> technique <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/166246-My-Secret-for-Color-Schemes">Cohesive Colors</a> in a 2016 Dribbble shot. To ensure that a color scheme doesnâ€™t consist of both harsh and soft tones, which may not work well outside of <a class="internal-link" href="/brutalist-web-design">Brutalist web design</a>, she overlays a central color on the others with reduced opacity, and chooses the colors that result from it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using this method for years to create and clean up color libraries.</p>

<p>I recently learned that Javier BÃ³rquez made a nifty <a href="https://javier.xyz/cohesive-colors/">tool</a> for it. Thatâ€™s great, because Iâ€™d been making screenshots for years, and results varied depending on the environment in which these screenshots were being used. Figma, Iâ€™m looking at you.</p>
