I"ß<p>Feelings of attachment one may have to a particular tool, physical or digital, in that this tool invokes a longing for a particular way of getting things done. Adjacent to the Portuguese ‚Äúsaudade‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="contextualized">Contextualized</h4>
<p>I‚Äôm aware that the following terms may (somewhat) describe this concept:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FOMO: fear of missing out on a particular experience, often invoked by social media imagery and other content of people engaging in this experience</li>
  <li>Chain of supply and demand</li>
  <li>Analysis paralysis</li>
  <li>Early adopter complex</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve found that tool vibes are a very particular longing, one that is caused by the omnipresence of the objects that these tools help us access: our experience of time, our list of tasks, our goals, our vision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Longing</li>
  <li>Visually heavy</li>
  <li>Problem solving is led by tool availability: I‚Äôve transformed my own problem by jumping to a tool even if it didn‚Äôt entirely match, just to experience the relief of having solved my problem</li>
</ul>
