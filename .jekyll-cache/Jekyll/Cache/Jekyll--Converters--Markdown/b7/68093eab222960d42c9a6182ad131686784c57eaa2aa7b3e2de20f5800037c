I"³<p>In many ways, 2015 was a transformative year for me. I dropped out of seminary because, frankly, I felt too gay. I was working on a novel, I was tutoring, and I was slowly, very slowly, growing out of a 6-year relationship.</p>

<p>Much of my soundtrack of 2015 is made up of party songs that played at the bars I used to frequent while I was living in Haarlem. The feelings invoked by some of these songs are entirely devoted to a particular crush I would have had at the time.</p>

<p>Each song has the capacity to bring me back precisely to that period of time, in such a way that my body feels it. When everything seemed uncertain, rollercoaster-scary, and every fiber in me was yearning yearning yearning for whatever was perpetually out of reach.</p>
