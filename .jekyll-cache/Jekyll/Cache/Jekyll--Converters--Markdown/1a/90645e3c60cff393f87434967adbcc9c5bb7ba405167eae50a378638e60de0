<p>Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesnâ€™t land me in a FOMO-inducing Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. Itâ€™s another one of the <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Habits  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. Itâ€™s pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also one of the few moments of solitude and focus I allow myself this week, apparently. Now that Iâ€™m beginning to reintegrate back into work at <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Leeruniek  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, I seem to have forgotten how much down time my body still requires. Iâ€™ve received a work assignment, on which Iâ€™ll get to work independently, and Iâ€™m excited. Curious. Hungry. On the cusp of small-scale overdrive. I had to stop working precisely because of this.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s boring.</p>

<p>Then I remember and old way to find calm and relaxation. <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/">The voices of Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant, telling me about stuff I should know</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saw Hannah Gadsbyâ€™s <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Body of Work  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and had a brief, cogent crush on her</li>
  <li>Saw a large number of Twitter folks join the much kinder Mastodon club. Iâ€™m slowly beginning to feel comfortable about the platform, and how it invites me to share my thoughts.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m thinking a lot about what ex-Twitter designer <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@jon@social.lot23.com/109372263710282940">Jon Bell</a> said about Twitterâ€™s user experience trajectory. I keep saying out loud how central the difference between <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Do the right thing|doing the right thing  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Do the thing right|doing the thing right  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> is to the design work I do.</li>
