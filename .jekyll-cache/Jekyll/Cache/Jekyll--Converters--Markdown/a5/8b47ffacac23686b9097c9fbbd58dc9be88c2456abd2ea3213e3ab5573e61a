I"<p>Hello, I’m Zinzy, and I enjoy meeting new people. If you have something to share, you’d like to play or learn together, or can think of any othe reason we should be talking, get in touch with me.</p>

<p>(Some of your answers might be found on my <a class="internal-link" href="/faq">faq</a> page.)</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is by sending me an email. If you attach my first name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@pm.me</code>, it’ll find its way to my inbox.</p>

<p>Get in touch if you’d like to work or learn together, have something to share, or want to say hi. If you would like to be notified when there are new posts on this site, <a href="http://eepurl.com/gH9of1">sign up</a> to receive a weekly or monthly email digest.</p>

<p>If your inquiry is related to marketing (guest posts, backlink requests, sponsored content, etc.), please see my <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/details/">policies</a>. TL;DR version: I don’t generally do that stuff, this is a personal site.</p>
