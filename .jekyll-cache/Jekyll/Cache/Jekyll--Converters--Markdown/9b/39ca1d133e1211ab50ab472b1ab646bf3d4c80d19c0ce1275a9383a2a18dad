I"©<p>Iâ€™ve been a practitioner of yoga for about sixteen years now. These last few years Iâ€™ve begun concentrating on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>yin yoga and nidra yoga. I prefer an implementation of yoga that is provided by small-group, non-athletic, seemingly homely settings. For a while, I practised at Delight Yoga, which has a number of large spaces in the city. In recent times, Iâ€™ve come to enjoy Thrive Yoga, which is close to my house, and incredibly small.</li>

<h3 id="how-i-like-my-yoga">How I like my yoga</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slow pace</li>
  <li>Calm atmosphere</li>
  <li>A soundtrack made up of non-pop, low-lyric music</li>
  <li>Low number of participants</li>
</ul>
