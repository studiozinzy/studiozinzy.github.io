I"ý<p>In the name of destigmatization of health issues I decided a while ago that I was going to use this website to write about what it means to have an eating disorder.</p>

<p>Hello, yes, I have one. It feels strange to say that out loud on the Internet, but Iâ€™ve been wanting to say it for a while now, so here we are. I think visibility and destigmatization of things such as eating disorders is important. Iâ€™m using this page to chronicle some of the experiences Iâ€™ve had in my ongoing recovery.</p>
