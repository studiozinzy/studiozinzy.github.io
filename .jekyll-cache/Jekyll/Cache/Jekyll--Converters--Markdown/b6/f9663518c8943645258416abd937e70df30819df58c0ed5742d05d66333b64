<h3 id="stationery">Stationery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I only use one pen: the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Eye-Rollerball-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/12016"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ve inherited Anjaâ€™s kitchen utensil snobbery and have become a big fan of<a href="https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas"> Le Creusetâ€™s silicone spatula series</a>. I wouldnâ€™t know how to cook a proper meal without them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="luggage">Luggage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Over the Summer, I got myself a <a href="https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010">Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack</a>. Fanny packs are notoriously sizeist, but luckily this packâ€™s extra belt makes for a create extension, giving me the support I need.</li>
</ul>
