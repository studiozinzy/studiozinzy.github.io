I"¡<p>‚ÄúHemelse modder‚Äù is a rich, creamy chocolate dessert from the Netherlands. My grandma used to make it for Christmas every year, and she sadly passed away before anyone could tease the recipe out of her. I‚Äôm making an attempt at making the dish my own.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carried out the same steps, with these alterations:
    <ul>
      <li>Used the prescribed dark chocolate I missed the first time (3/4 dark, 1/4 milk)</li>
      <li>Left out 10 grams of sugar when mixing with egg yoke to offset sweet flavor I didn‚Äôt love the first time</li>
      <li>Used our KitchenAid‚Äôs mixing bowl to make the whipped cream, and used a separate steel bowl to mix the egg whites with sugar. This meant holding the bowl up to the KitchenAid, which, while more practical ingredient-wise, was not something I‚Äôd recommend.</li>
      <li>Checked if chocolate was at room temperature before mixing in the egg yoke, put it in freezer for a few minutes before doing so</li>
      <li>Covered the egg white mixture with saran wrap. Noticed it had shifted a little bit once I was ready to mix it in. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because it was in the bowl longer, because I illegally used a different bowl to mix, because it took longer, or something else.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dish came out with much better flavor and more vibrant color!</li>
</ul>
