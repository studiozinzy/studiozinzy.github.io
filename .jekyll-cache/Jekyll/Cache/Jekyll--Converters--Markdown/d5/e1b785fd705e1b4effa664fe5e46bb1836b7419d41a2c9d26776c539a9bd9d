I"Q<p>Since late 2020 Iâ€™ve been a part of the wonderful team of <a href="https://www.leeruniek.nl">Leeruniek</a>, a scale-up in education technology that was founded in 2015. I joined Leeruniek predominantly because I liked the things they told me about using data for good, and working autonomously in a design-forward product team.</p>
