I"|<p>Saw this movie on [[2022-12-19]] at [[Studio K]], expecting something slightly weird about a cruise. It’s a good thing I stopped reading after that, because the pirates and the land mine, the resulting ship wreck and ensuing <em>Survivor</em> narrative were quite the thrill. I love about this movie the diffuse accents (although I’m sure A. would’ve pointed out Charlbi Dean Kriek’s South-African accent within minutes), reminds me vaguely of that German show <em>Dark</em>. Thought I recognized Harris Dickinson, and learned later it’s from <em>Beach Rats</em>, which I think I must’ve given up on halfway through.</p>
