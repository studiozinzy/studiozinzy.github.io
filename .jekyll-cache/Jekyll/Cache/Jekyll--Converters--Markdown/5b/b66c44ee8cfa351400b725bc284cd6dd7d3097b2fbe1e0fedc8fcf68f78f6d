I"š<p>Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesnâ€™t land me in a personalized Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. Itâ€™s another one of the <a class="internal-link" href="/habits">habits</a> I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. Itâ€™s pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered.</p>

<h3 id="whats-top-of-mind-right-now">Whatâ€™s top of mind right now</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Saw Hannah Gadsbyâ€™s <a class="internal-link" href="/body-of-work">Body of Work</a> and had a brief, cogent crush on her</li>
  <li>Saw a large number of Twitter folks join the much kinder Mastodon club</li>
  <li>Thought about what Jon Bell shared about the user experiences of Twitter, and how important it is for me to remember that appreciating the difference between <a class="internal-link" href="/do-the-right-thing">doing the right thing</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/do-the-thing-right">doing the thing right</a> is central to how I operate as a designer.</li>
</ul>
