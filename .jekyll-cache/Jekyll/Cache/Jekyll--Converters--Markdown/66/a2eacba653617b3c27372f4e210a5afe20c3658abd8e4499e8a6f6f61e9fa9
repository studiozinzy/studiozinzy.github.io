<p>Youâ€™ve reached the personal website of me, Zinzy Waleson, a researcher and designer from Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. You may start by learning more <a class="internal-link" href="/about">about me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-website">How to use this website</h2>
<p>This website is a happy mishmash of things Iâ€™ve written since I first learned how to build websites in the 90s. Itâ€™s part diary, part digital garden, part unpretentious portfolio. At the moment, Iâ€™m sifting through my archives to find lost gems, and the digital garden is growing every day. Currently, there are <span>95</span> undated notes that are perpetually subject to change.</p>

<p>Here are some places to start:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  diary  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></li>
  <li>My <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a> page will tell you what Iâ€™m up to</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a> is all about what Iâ€™m attending, reading, watching</li>
  <li><a class="internal-link" href="/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> contains links of the websites I like</li>
</ul>
