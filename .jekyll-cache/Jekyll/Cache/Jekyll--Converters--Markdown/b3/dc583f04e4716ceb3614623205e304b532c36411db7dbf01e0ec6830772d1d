I"<p>“Do the thing right” is the opposite of <a class="internal-link" href="/do-the-right-thing">Do the right thing</a>, which is an important imperative in the world of digital products and <a class="internal-link" href="/design">Design</a>.</p>

<p>Doing the right thing can be something fairly small, like not being racist towards your employee while operating a pizza parlor in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of New York[^1], or it can be big. Such became clear to us all over the course of the past decade, as we saw tech giants rise, rise, rise, and fall, fall, fall.</p>

<p>If the direct effect it has on human lives weren’t so dreadful, I would be mesmerized by the sheer <em>Black Mirror</em>-ness of what large social media platforms have managed to create in the world.</p>

      <li>The “thing” to “do right” can be execution of a correctly-identified, ethically-sound solution. It can also be the method with which we identify said problems.</li>
      <li>I’ve personally reached an interesting threshold on which I wonder: how should I interpret and incorporate the design of people working at companies who don’t have users’ best interest at heart?</li>
