<p>I’ve worked as a gardener, cigarette seller, a barosta, a bookseller, a research assistant, a telemarketer, a bartender, a ti</p>

<p>Benjamin Brood has worked as a stevedore, a bike courier, a busboy, a demolitionist, a line cook, a janitor, a smuggler, a carnival barker, a programmer, a bowling alley pinsetter, a clockwinder, an eggler, a bookseller, a painter. He lives somewhere north in the mountains.</p>

<p>I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like to tell a good story. Firstly, I do this here, on my personal website. This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. You’ll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare. Check out my <a class="internal-link" href="/colophon">colophon</a> to learn more about this space.</p>

<p>I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet, and I aim to bring the same to the people who use the things I make. At present, I manage design and product at Leeruniek, a startup in educational technology. It’s great to be part of a magnificent group curious folks looking to make the world better for crucial workers. Before this, I spent five years leading design at Airtrade, a market leader in travel technology. I cut my creative teeth at Studio Zinzy, which I founded in 2008 to pay not so much for the books and beers I needed in university.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands, in a complex childhood marked by marching bands, an overabundance of food, and question marks about who, amid everybody else, I am.</p>

<p>I came to Utrecht to study the letters, and I enjoyed the seemingly endless learning opportunities that university life provides. I ran an absurdit magazine, worked as a freelance photographer on the side. I earned my undergraduate degree in language and literature with a thesis on focalization in the graphic novel adaptation of a Dutch classic. Narratology, adaptation, and transmediality remain some of my favorite topics.</p>

<p>Before I put my study books on the shelf for good, I spent a year in seminary studying theology at VU University. It taught me volumes on church history, how infinitely weird Scripture really is, and how strong one’s back must be to be a queer person studying alongside young, fierce conservatives. I left after a year.</p>

<p>As an afropean queer person of color, travelling life isn’t the most straightforward endeavor. In the past few years I’ve been involved in founding and leading queer community spaces for people to connect and recharge. As a queer facilitator, I enjoy bringing together people from all walks of life. In the Spring of 2018, I founded Queer Salon, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam. In 2020, on the cusp of the pandemic, I joined Vine &amp; Fig.</p>

<h3 id="life-these-days">Life these days</h3>

<p>I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, I’m a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.</p>
