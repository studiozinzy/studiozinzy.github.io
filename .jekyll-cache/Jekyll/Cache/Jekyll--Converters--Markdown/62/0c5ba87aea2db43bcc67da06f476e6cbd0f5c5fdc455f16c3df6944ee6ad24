I"k<p>This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. Youâ€™ll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts. I deliberately underplay the work I do, not because it is so spectacular, but because this space is not a portfolio.</p>
