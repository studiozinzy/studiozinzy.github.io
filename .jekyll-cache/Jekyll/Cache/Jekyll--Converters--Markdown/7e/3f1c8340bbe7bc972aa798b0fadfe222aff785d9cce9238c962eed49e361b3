I"ç<p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Zinzy. I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like a good story. Thank you for visiting my website.</p>

<p>I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence that Internet gives us. My work aims to bring those values to people solving problems at work. I currently manage design at <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>, where weâ€™re taking an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable educational data. Before this I spent five years at Airtrade, a market leader in travel technology. I got my start in UX as a freelancer, running my own design studio for eight years.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-history">A little history</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands, in a complex childhood marked by marching bands, an overabundance of food, and question marks about who, amid everybody else, I am.</p>

<p>I came to <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Utrecht  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> to study the letters, and I enjoyed the seemingly endless opportunities that university life provides while running Studio Zinzy. I earned my undergraduate degree in language and literature with a thesis on focalization in the graphic novel adaptation of a Dutch classic.</p>

<p>Before I put my study books on the shelf for good, I spent a year in seminary studying theology. It taught me volumes on church history, how infinitely weird and beautiful the Bible really is, and how strong oneâ€™s back must be in order to pursue an MDiv as a Black queer person alongside young, fierce,  conservatives. I left after a year and found my way into corporate UX life.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-magic">A little magic</h3>
<p>As an afropean queer person, travelling life isnâ€™t the most straightforward endeavor. In the past few years Iâ€™ve been involved in founding and leading queer community spaces for people eager to connect and recharge. As a queer facilitator, I enjoy bringing together people from all walks of life. In the Spring of 2018, I founded Queer Salon, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam. In 2020, on the cusp of the pandemic, I joined Vine &amp; Fig.</p>

<h3 id="life-these-days">Life these days</h3>
<p>I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, reading, making <a class="internal-link" href="/music">Music</a>, embroidery, gardening, <a class="internal-link" href="/cooking">Cooking</a>, cinema, and biking.</p>
