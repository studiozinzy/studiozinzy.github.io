I"z<p>The latest trend in online publishing, a digital garden is a publicly available collection of notes in various stages of refinement, tended to and updated online for everyone to see. It sits snuggly in between a blog and a one-person wiki.</p>

<p>To me, it’s the culmination of the folder plain text files I’ve been maintaining since around 2005, which exist in my <a class="internal-link" href="/second-brain">second brain</a>. The ones you can see here have been made available to the public. the vast majority of them are kept private for a myriad of reasons.</p>

<p>This space has been around since 2004, in a variety of shapes and under a lot of different names. It has been a blog, a photo blog, a portfolio, a directory, and a one-pager. Its first name was doyoulikemytightsweater.com.</p>

<p>What I like about this technique of organizing media is that it allows a practitioner to write (and therefore perhaps think) in a more molecular way. One oft-highlighted benefit of this is that, as time goes on, nodes might be shared across a number of ideas, making the practitioner aware of connections previously unacknowledged.</p>
