I"Æ<p>As a designer, I am very much not the first one to consider that treating people like users invokes unappetizing metaphors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The user as an addict:</strong> with a revenue model that requires boundless growth, design decisions seemingly neglect to ask whether increased engagement with a product is effective in oneâ€™s grander scheme of things</li>
  <li><strong>The user as a number:</strong> it may be inviting to</li>
</ul>
