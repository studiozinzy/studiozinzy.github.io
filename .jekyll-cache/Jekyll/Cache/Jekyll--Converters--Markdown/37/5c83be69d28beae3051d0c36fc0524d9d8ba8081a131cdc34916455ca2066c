I"<p>I’m Zinzy, a person living and working in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.</p>

<p>I’m a researcher and designer making tools for people at work, a facilitator making resonant queer spaces, and a humble linguist who enjoys the art of writing.</p>

<p>This website is a vastly personal project.</p>

<hr />

<p>Central to this website is a growing collection of undated notes that are perpetually subject to change. Currently, there are <span>99</span> notes. There is no index or archive or these notes. Instead, I invite you to start here: <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="/bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> or <a class="internal-link" href="/about">About</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re more into the traditional, dated nature of blogs, check out my <a class="internal-link" href="/journal/">journal</a>.</p>
