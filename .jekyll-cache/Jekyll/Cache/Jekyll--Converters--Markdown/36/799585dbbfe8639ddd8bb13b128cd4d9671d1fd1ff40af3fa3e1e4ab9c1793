I"ı<p>This here is a quiet corner of the Internet where I come to link and think. You‚Äôll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a ‚Äúdigital garden‚Äù, a casual collection of unfinished thoughts, not a portfolio of any kind.</p>
