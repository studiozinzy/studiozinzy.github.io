I"Ž<p>Each year Iâ€™m less embarrassed to say it: I donâ€™t like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays thereâ€™s Kingâ€™s Day and Liberation Day, and Iâ€™ve found it really messes with my head. I donâ€™t mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.</p>
