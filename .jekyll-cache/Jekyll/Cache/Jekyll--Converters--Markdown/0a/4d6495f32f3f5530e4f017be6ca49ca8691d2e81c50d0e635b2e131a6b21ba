I"Y<p>In my professional capacity, I am one among many people stating that treating people like users is bad. Even outside of the design and product world there seems to be a growing understanding of how expensive privacy, attention, and autonomy really are on the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-user">The anatomy of a user</h3>
<p>The growing body of product knowledge establishes ideas of “The User” that can lead to unappetizing metaphors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User as a number</li>
  <li>User as an addict</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-thing">The right thing</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding users helps us to the thing right, understanding people helps us do the right thing.</p>
