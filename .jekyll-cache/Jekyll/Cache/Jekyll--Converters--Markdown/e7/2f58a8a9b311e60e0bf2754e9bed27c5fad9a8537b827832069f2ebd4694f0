I" <p>I’ve been maintaining a single folder of plain text notes for about two decades now. Many of these notes are private. Some, however, make it into this public place, a digital garden of sorts. I let it be a place where mistakes can live, <a class="internal-link" href="/ideas-can-change">Ideas can change</a>, and where questions are more important than answers.</p>

<p>As an act of <a class="internal-link" href="/anti-marketing">Anti-marketing</a>, although I believe that, on the Internet very little of the sort can exist, I write these notes for me, not for you. Because of this, there is no index. Rather, it’s a scavenger hunt of sorts.</p>

<p>Good places to start are <a class="internal-link" href="/now">Now</a>, and <a class="internal-link" href="/consumption">Consumption</a>.</p>
