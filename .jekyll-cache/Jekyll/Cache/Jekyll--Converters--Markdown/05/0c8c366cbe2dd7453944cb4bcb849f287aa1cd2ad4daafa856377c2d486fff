I"ÿ<p>I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like a good story. I have about sixteen years of experience making digital products.</p>

<h3 id="my-expertise-enterprise-ux">My expertise: enterprise UX</h3>
<p>Through my years working as a professional designer, Iâ€™ve come to learn that thereâ€™s one type of thing I like to design best: <a class="internal-link" href="/tools-for-people-at-work">digital products people use to solve problems at work</a>. Iâ€™m fascinated by the complexities and challenges that this field brings.</p>

<p>Currently I manage UX at <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>, where weâ€™re taking an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable educational data. My work aims to bring creativity and autonomy to people working in primary education.</p>

  <li><strong>Mentoring:</strong> what I like best about my job is helping other designers flourish in their field.</li>
