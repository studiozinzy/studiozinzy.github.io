I"Ó<p>Iâ€™ve been a practitioner of yoga for about sixteen years now. These last few years Iâ€™ve begun concentrating on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Yin yoga</strong>, a slow-paced style of yoga that focuses on mild poses held for a longer period of time, which increases the practitionerâ€™s focus on boundaries and stretching them. I love yin because its goal is not to let our bodies land in a pose, but rather to let the pose help us better land in our bodies.</li>
  <li><strong>Yoga nidra</strong>, a very quiet form of yoga usually induced by a guided meditation, which lets the practitioner land in a state between being awake and being asleep. I use nidra as a means of learning more about how much rest my body needs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Slow paced</li>
  <li>Calm atmosphere</li>
  <li>A soundtrack made up of non-pop, low-lyric music</li>
  <li>Small number of participants</li>
  <li>Some soft talk of what may happen in my body during a pose</li>
  <li>Little talk of</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-i-practice">How I practice</h3>
<p>At the moment, I practice yoga both at home and at my favorite studio, <a href="https://thriveyoga.nl/">Thrive Yoga</a>. Itâ€™s a small space with great teachers, as well as the perfect atmosphere. Before this, Iâ€™ve tried out various studios in <a class="internal-link" href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, including Delight Yoga, Yoga Zenter, BlueBirds Yoga, and Sukha Yoga, mostly through OneFit.</p>
