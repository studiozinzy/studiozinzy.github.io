I"ô<p>When it comes to binging through an entire television series, I feel A and I are doing it right with this one. We began <a class="internal-link" href="/what-i-consume">watching</a> the 80s and 90s hit series <em>The Golden Girls</em> in the Summer of 2022, and weâ€™re going at a rate of one episode at a time.</p>

<p>It is glorious.</p>

<p>My favorite things about the show so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Betty White was surprisingly sexy</li>
  <li>The wordless shade that Dorothy throws just by making a certain phase is, to me, the best thing in comedy</li>
  <li>I attribute this to the showâ€™s age, but I love the fact that their comedy pauses last at minimum five times longer than any other sitcom Iâ€™ve seen</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s great to be reminded that, without this show, there wouldâ€™ve been no <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Sex and the City  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></li>
</ul>
