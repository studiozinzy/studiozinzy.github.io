<p>I exist at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like to tell a good story. Firstly, I do this here, on my personal website. I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet, and I aim to bring the same to the people who use the things I make.</p>

<p>At present, I manage design and product at Leeruniek, a startup in educational technology. Itâ€™s great to be part of a magnificent group of humble, smart folks who like to make the world better to handle for crucial workers.</p>

<p>(<a class="internal-link" href="/colophon">read more about what that means for this website</a>). This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. Youâ€™ll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare.</p>

<h3 id="in-life">In life</h3>
<p>I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, Iâ€™m a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>For the past fifteen years Iâ€™ve been making a living as a researcher and designer of digital products. Iâ€™ve worked across a variety of industries, and with startups and small business owners as well as industry leaders. For the past seven years Iâ€™ve been specializing in making <a class="internal-link" href="/tools-for-people-at-work">tools for people at work</a>.</p>
