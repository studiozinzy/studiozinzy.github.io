I"_<p>Hey there, thank you for visiting my personal site! I’ve been using this space (and before it, others) to navigate the web since I was eleven years old. I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet (<a href="/colophon">read more about what that means for this website</a>). This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. You’ll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare.</p>

<h2 id="in-life">In life</h2>
<p>I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, I’m a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.</p>

<h2 id="at-work">At work</h2>
<p>For the past fifteen years I’ve been making a living as a researcher and designer of digital products. I’ve worked across a variety of industries, and with startups and small business owners as well as industry leaders. For the past seven years I’ve been specializing in making <a class="internal-link" href="/tools-for-people-at-work">tools for people at work</a>.</p>
