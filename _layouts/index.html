  <p>I'm Zinzy, a person living and working in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I'm a researcher and designer making tools for people at work, a facilitator making resonant queer spaces, and a humble linguist who enjoys the art of writing. This website is a vastly personal project.</p>
