I'm Zinzy Waleson, a Dutch Afropean person living and working in Amsterdam. I enjoy the art of personal web publishing. This website contains working notes on a variety of topics, as well as casual updates on what's keeping me busy.

## Home
I share a little shoebox on the [[Amsterdam]] East side with Anja, who is, and I'm biased, dynamite. I enjoy learning the love language of cooking, urban gardening, embroidery, and making music. I have a penchant for shameless reality television, Barbra Streisand music, and monster disaster movies. I'm a practitioner of unguided meditation.

## Work
While I'm currently on sick leave, I manage User Experience and Product at Leeruniek, a scale-up in education technology. I've been with them since 2020. Before this, I spent five years leading design at Airtrade, a leader in travel technology. Between 2008 and 2015, I ran my own design studio.


## Even more facts
- My academic background is in comparative literature and theology. First and foremost, this means I like a good story.
- I have an enduring illness that excellent caregivers help me manage.
- I'm a lifelong language geek
