Hello, I'm [[about|Zinzy Waleson]] from [[Amsterdam]]. You've reached my [[personal website]], where I come to link and think. This space is an incomplete, unironic record of soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. You'll find that when I'm not at [[work]] managing UX and Product, I enjoy a wide variety of [[hobbies]].
