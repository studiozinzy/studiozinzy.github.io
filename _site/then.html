<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôm interested to read some of Germaine Greer‚Äôs work. I like how, beyond the initial shock value of things she has said, there is a very blatant truth that I‚Äôm happy to engage with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After six weeks in the Algarve to continue recovering from an <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">Eating disorder</a>, I‚Äôm readjusting to bustling Amsterdam and establishing new <a class="internal-link" href="/habits">Habits</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before Portugal, I was notoriously rubbish at dreaming about what I‚Äôd want my life to be like. I‚Äôve returned with a renewed sense of agency, and a small-but-growing <a class="internal-link" href="/bucket-list">bucket list</a> to boot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting settled it at my new <a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">yoga</a> studio Thrive Yoga.</p>

<h3 id="may-2022">May 2022</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thinking about visual literacy, in part because the bulk of <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55" target="_blank">Anja</a>‚Äôs academic work is focused on it right now, but also because I just love telling people off whenever they say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/07/a-novel-idea-is-the-book-always-better-than-the-film" target="_blank">‚Äúthe book is better than the movie‚Äù</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôm interested in learning about buddhism, but I don‚Äôt know where to start. Everything seems either too technical or too Pinterst quotesque. A trusted source tells me Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Herman Hesse‚Äôs <em>Siddharta</em> are good entry point. Off we go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôve been mentoring over on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene" target="_blank">ADPList</a> for a while now, and I can only say I‚Äôm truly enjoying it. It‚Äôs great to work with researchers, designers, and product managers in different stages of their careers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After months of being, in essense, a recruitment manager, we added two new amazing talents to our team. I have one more role to fill, but I‚Äôm very pleased that the bulk of my time at work now goes to research, **strategy, mentoring, and operations. Feels good to be back. In all of it, I‚Äôm working to rely on my intuition, and to ask better questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I‚Äôve been experimenting with new dishes: Teriyaki steak rolls, and Miso Yaki Onigiri</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We‚Äôve been into <em>The Staircase</em>. I remember watching it years ago, and now that the rather satisfying HBO series is available, we‚Äôre rewatching the documentary for extra context. It‚Äôs striking to see what role anti-queer rhetoric played in the investigation and media coverage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Things look a little bit different on this site, and that‚Äôs mainly because I built it again, this time using Maxime Vaillancourt‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template" target="_blank">digital garden Jekyll template</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attended <a class="internal-link" href="/uxinsight-festival-2022">UXInsight Festival 2022</a> and enjoyed it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="april-2022">April 2022</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. We‚Äôve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>

<p>At Leeruniek, I‚Äôm focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. It‚Äôs great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We‚Äôre also hiring in the product team and we‚Äôve already found a new engineer and a new designer. I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring our new team setup.</p>

<h3 id="september-2021">September 2021</h3>

<p>Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. I‚Äôm looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in <em>You‚Äôve Got Mail</em>, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. I‚Äôm also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.</p>

<p>What I‚Äôm enjoying spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app, as well as CelinaSpookyBoo‚Äôs dad jokes and her accompanying laugh. I‚Äôve been reading about chronic shame. I‚Äôve been playing around with Gatsby starters for a bit, and I‚Äôm ready to begin building things from scratch.</p>
