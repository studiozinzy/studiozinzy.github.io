  <li>I can remember what was taught in my Applied Linguistics class by the shirt my professor wore.</li>
  <li>My biggest secret is an unending fascination for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momversation">Momversation</a> in which mommy bloggers discuss motherhood.</li>
  <li>Some people in my Dutch Language and Culture program are bad at spelling. All of them want to be writers.</li>
  <li>Times a day I realize I probably don‚Äôt want kids: 17.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm terrified of failing University. During the day I‚Äôm scared, and when I‚Äôm not scared, I‚Äôm asleep. I‚Äôm a 4.5 GPA.</li>
  <li>Sometimes I miss Fr√©d√©rique Huydts.</li>
  <li>Annual occasions that prompt a re-reading of <em>Bridget Jones‚Äô Diary</em>: birthday and New Year‚Äôs.</li>

        <p>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother‚Äôs cousins‚Äô daughters‚Äô coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs a change of strategy, and of pace.</p>

<p>This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on. No more updates on my general well-being, college achievements, and peculiar trains of thought. Sure, there‚Äôs enough happening, but the focus isn‚Äôt where it should be: on a white piece of paper. Instead of feeling shame about my lack of commitment, I will simply change the contents.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would adjust my expectations for this particular website: pictures without explanations, cryptic musings, things I like, things I wish to remember, and sometimes the old blog post. Or a combination of all of the above, or something entirely different. You have been warned.</p>

<p>Sorry.
Love you too.</p>

        <p>I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.</p>

<p>Choosing was never my strong suit. I could stand there for hours, by the neatly arranged tables of school supplies. After all, they would have to last me the entire school year. The right supplies, this I figured, would lead to the right achievements. I was so young back then.</p>

<p>Year after year I‚Äôd find myself biking to town in the Summer months. Cover paper, new pencils, a nice fountain pen, snazzy fineliners. Preferably all the things.</p>

<p>Today, I went to shop for new supplies. I‚Äôll be starting my freshman year of university, after a one-year hiatus. I hadn‚Äôt made a list, I figured a veteran like me could do without it on a trip like this. As soon as I‚Äôd get to the store, all the requirements would come to me.</p>

<p>The one thing I was keen on finding was a four-subject notebook, one for each course. And after that? Well, that was about it. I did already have a pencil case. And a fountain pen. And pencils. And binders. And a backpack. And a diary.</p>

<p>Home I went, with a teeny tiny plastic bag and two A5 notebooks.</p>

<p>After nine years, I realize I have everything I need. I no longer believe I need certain things to achieve my goals. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of doing the work, with everything I need just within reach.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go.</p>
