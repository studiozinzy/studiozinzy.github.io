        <p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

        <p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br />
you know it’s another one<br />
“Trans Life Survivors”<br />
says the cover<br />
“Merry Christmas!”<br />
says your sister<br />
you have only been using<br />
they/them pronouns<br />
in private<br />
for a year or so<br />
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br />
the ex-gay book<br />
your other sister presented to you<br />
on your birthday last month</p>

<p>At family dinner you<br />
spend bathroom breaks in your<br />
childhood bedroom<br />
five in total<br />
logging on to talk to us<br />
about how the heavy things feel<br />
being the punching bag<br />
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br />
practises her right hook<br />
screaming fire about<br />
her trans classmate<br />
stings<br />
and<br />
it stings<br />
like a shattered jaw</p>

<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br />
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br />
Covid-style<br />
each of the siblings hosting<br />
the entire family<br />
for a portion of the day<br />
hopping from house to house<br />
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br />
a big family will<br />
At the fourth stop you are full<br />
zonking off into the distance<br />
catching the smiling face of your<br />
sister-in-law on the way there<br />
and you remember what<br />
it felt like when<br />
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>

<p>For you and them<br />
there is no Family<br />
not since you came out as non-binary<br />
and your parents<br />
yelled<br />
“check please”<br />
the only trace of<br />
those you came from<br />
is the card your grandmother sent<br />
She writes “I wanted you to<br />
know I support you”<br />
She is a sweetheart<br />
it is a teardrop in the desert<br />
that you cling to</p>

<p>Your father was no exception<br />
first the pandemic<br />
now the respirator<br />
the store has been extra busy these days<br />
but you’re getting by<br />
it’s keeping your mind off<br />
of how much he was hoping<br />
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br />
Today, the phone call<br />
from the hospital<br />
lets you know that<br />
he can come home for Christmas<br />
The disappointment you feel<br />
sits in your body like a monster</p>

<p>You have all the time in the world<br />
to tell me how you’re doing<br />
but not a moment to yourself<br />
to commit to the act<br />
with all those relatives in the house<br />
prone to restricting themselves to<br />
those parts of the Bible<br />
that make Christianity look easy<br />
and you being back<br />
in the home of your youth<br />
after the attempt<br />
confirms what you fear and<br />
what your parents have been saying<br />
is true about your life<br />
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br />
your father said<br />
You wonder how gay<br />
he knows you are<br />
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br />
the Pride flag that I sent you<br />
as a housewarming gift</p>

<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of the Lord is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>

        When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”

        Let us meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I am mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in the bodies of other people. My Jewish partner will do the eye roll of eye rolls and say: “funny how you all kind of _do that_.”

        If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis.

  <p>I’ve heard someone compare it to the relationship between a parent and a child. I imagine a child wanting to create a birthday card for his mother, opting to draw her portrait on the cover. Does that child draw a lifelike portrait of his mother? No, but it sure is endearing. I just want to draw the most beautiful portrait I can with the colors I got from my Mother.</p>
