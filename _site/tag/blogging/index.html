        <p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>

<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>

<p>By now it is such a clich√© to even say it, but I don‚Äôt like the monolith that we‚Äôve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn‚Äôt. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>

<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I‚Äôve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

        <p>The only journal I‚Äôve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.</p>

<p>The problem with my offline photo journalling habit was that I could never enjoy looking at my photos. There were no visuals to support my Finder, and I loved seeing them come together when arranged in a certain way. So, for approximately five years I didn‚Äôt really look at any of the photographs I took.</p>

<p>Today, a tiny new chapter opens up with the birth of a new website dedicated to these photographs. I‚Äôm in the process of selecting the ones I love most from 2005-now, and publishing them in a horizontal fashion. They‚Äôre relatively small, always have to be seen in relation to each other, and are created by a collection of cameras. They were taken for a number of reasons; many for clients, but even more for my personal gratification.</p>

<p>As of now the website is located at <a href="http://zinzygeene.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, but that will most likely change to a more personalized address. I‚Äôm contemplating using <em>zinzygeene.nl</em>, which I think is always a joke when it comes to a serious portfolio website, or another one I have registered. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I‚Äôve taken it down because I can‚Äôt get over Tumblr‚Äôs problem with ownership.</p>

        <p>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother‚Äôs cousins‚Äô daughters‚Äô coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs a change of strategy, and of pace.</p>

<p>This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on. No more updates on my general well-being, college achievements, and peculiar trains of thought. Sure, there‚Äôs enough happening, but the focus isn‚Äôt where it should be: on a white piece of paper. Instead of feeling shame about my lack of commitment, I will simply change the contents.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would adjust my expectations for this particular website: pictures without explanations, cryptic musings, things I like, things I wish to remember, and sometimes the old blog post. Or a combination of all of the above, or something entirely different. You have been warned.</p>

<p>Sorry.
Love you too.</p>
