        <p>Sometimes I<br />
feel that I am<br />
a <br />
bad<br />
Black<br />
girl<br />
because whenever<br />
my white girlfriend<br />
and I sift through<br />
Netflix<br />
Prime Video<br />
or anything<br />
with a reasonable trial<br />
period<br />
and she says “let’s <br />
watch this<br />
movie or that”<br />
featuring Black stories <br />
I instead<br />
elect to watch a white<br />
narrative<br />
because it’s nice<br />
to forget <br />
about <br />
racism<br />
and the teacher<br />
who called me <br />
a monkey<br />
and<br />
the no one<br />
who called him<br />
out<br />
and<br />
being a bit<br />
Black<br />
and being<br />
a bit<br />
white</p>

        <p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br />
you know it’s another one<br />
“Trans Life Survivors”<br />
says the cover<br />
“Merry Christmas!”<br />
says your sister<br />
you have only been using<br />
they/them pronouns<br />
in private<br />
for a year or so<br />
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br />
the ex-gay book<br />
your other sister presented to you<br />
on your birthday last month</p>

<p>At family dinner you<br />
spend bathroom breaks in your<br />
childhood bedroom<br />
five in total<br />
logging on to talk to us<br />
about how the heavy things feel<br />
being the punching bag<br />
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br />
practises her right hook<br />
screaming fire about<br />
her trans classmate<br />
stings<br />
and<br />
it stings<br />
like a shattered jaw</p>

<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br />
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br />
Covid-style<br />
each of the siblings hosting<br />
the entire family<br />
for a portion of the day<br />
hopping from house to house<br />
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br />
a big family will<br />
At the fourth stop you are full<br />
zonking off into the distance<br />
catching the smiling face of your<br />
sister-in-law on the way there<br />
and you remember what<br />
it felt like when<br />
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>

<p>For you and them<br />
there is no Family<br />
not since you came out as non-binary<br />
and your parents<br />
yelled<br />
“check please”<br />
the only trace of<br />
those you came from<br />
is the card your grandmother sent<br />
She writes “I wanted you to<br />
know I support you”<br />
She is a sweetheart<br />
it is a teardrop in the desert<br />
that you cling to</p>

<p>Your father was no exception<br />
first the pandemic<br />
now the respirator<br />
the store has been extra busy these days<br />
but you’re getting by<br />
it’s keeping your mind off<br />
of how much he was hoping<br />
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br />
Today, the phone call<br />
from the hospital<br />
lets you know that<br />
he can come home for Christmas<br />
The disappointment you feel<br />
sits in your body like a monster</p>

<p>You have all the time in the world<br />
to tell me how you’re doing<br />
but not a moment to yourself<br />
to commit to the act<br />
with all those relatives in the house<br />
prone to restricting themselves to<br />
those parts of the Bible<br />
that make Christianity look easy<br />
and you being back<br />
in the home of your youth<br />
after the attempt<br />
confirms what you fear and<br />
what your parents have been saying<br />
is true about your life<br />
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br />
your father said<br />
You wonder how gay<br />
he knows you are<br />
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br />
the Pride flag that I sent you<br />
as a housewarming gift</p>

<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of the Lord is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>

who is so mad<br />
at the pandemic<br />
that he went on<br />
a six-day crack bender<br />
just to prove it<br />
“I’ve deleted the numbers<br />

man who changed my mind”<br />

His eyes reflect a me<br />
