        <p>This is a list of things I truly have no opinion on. It’s not that I have a negative opinion and I’m just sugarcoating it by saying I don’t have one. These are things of which, when I think about them, I am baffled to know they don’t trigger any form of criticism or evaluation.</p>

        <p>The only journal I’ve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.</p>

<p>The problem with my offline photo journalling habit was that I could never enjoy looking at my photos. There were no visuals to support my Finder, and I loved seeing them come together when arranged in a certain way. So, for approximately five years I didn’t really look at any of the photographs I took.</p>

<p>Today, a tiny new chapter opens up with the birth of a new website dedicated to these photographs. I’m in the process of selecting the ones I love most from 2005-now, and publishing them in a horizontal fashion. They’re relatively small, always have to be seen in relation to each other, and are created by a collection of cameras. They were taken for a number of reasons; many for clients, but even more for my personal gratification.</p>

<p>As of now the website is located at <a href="http://zinzygeene.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, but that will most likely change to a more personalized address. I’m contemplating using <em>zinzygeene.nl</em>, which I think is always a joke when it comes to a serious portfolio website, or another one I have registered. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve taken it down because I can’t get over Tumblr’s problem with ownership.</p>

        Yesterday, as I swiped through my digital September issue of Wired, I came across a bit that immediately swung me back right into my first year of high school. Presented on the page where a Nokia 3310, a 56k modem, a Dot-matrix printer, a Tube TV, and a Speak & Spell. It was a piece about the Museum of Endangered Sounds, a digital archive of sounds we all remember so, so well.

        <p>My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would love to have another life, 
just so I could spend it cursing
at everything, and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The negative character of this man is self-evident. He’s as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories. It makes hanging out with him a free afternoon at a comedy club. His lifestyle is perfectly suited for his disposition. I’m positive his house contains more rooms than even he can count. There is a room for his art, another one for the art his students produce, various studios, six bathrooms, and three separate kitchens. He lives alone where he is boss.</p>

<p>Paul is also much older than I am, think a young grandfather. I expect that his age plays a large part in how comfortable he is low-key hating everybody. I’m not so lucky. Whenever I find myself muttering that “I hate people”, my self-talk quickly turns to shame and guilt. What if mankind is, in fact, nice, and I just happen to not see it? What if all those people on trains producing noises that make me want to explode would happily carry on a conversation with me, if only I was open to some fun?</p>

<p>Sometimes I think it would be incredible to have a door in my house, one that only I have the key to. It opens to a world exactly like this, except that nobody there can hear me scream and curse. I would hang out there on occasion, using profanity so profane that Satan would eventually have to come in to please ask me to simmer down because I was offending all the racist, nazi pedophiles in the hottest, darkest corners of hell.</p>

<p>It isn’t so much that I am mad at anyone specific, but more so the earth as a whole with everything and everyone on it, including myself. Or maybe I’m not even mad, but rather afraid? I mean, that’s where anger sometimes comes from, right? Maybe if I take a pillow and shout into it really loudly, and then go back to doing whatever, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120114230620/http://itllbebetter.com/">it’ll be better</a>, and I’ll be able to get on with my day, working steadily towards artistic retirement in which I smoke excessively at my kitchen table like Paul, worrying about how many lives I need for all my expletives.</p>
