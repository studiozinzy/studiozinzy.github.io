      <p>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I‚Äôve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn‚Äôt always able to execute on them.</p>

<p>Lately, I‚Äôve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I‚Äôve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off</li>
  <li>Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in</li>
  <li>Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed</li>
  <li>Walk for one hour</li>
  <li>Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk</li>
  <li>Arrive home and update YNAB</li>
  <li>Plan my day</li>
  <li>Empty my email inbox</li>
  <li>Make a smoothie</li>
  <li>Start my daily meetings</li>
</ul>

      <p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren‚Äôt assigned at birth.</p>

<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use ‚Äúshe‚Äù, but really I‚Äôll listen to anything that‚Äôs not ‚Äúit‚Äù. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn‚Äôt the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the ‚Äúshe‚Äù that I was assigned at birth?</p>

<p>Yes, but also‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt mind ‚Äúshe‚Äù. To me, ‚Äúshe‚Äù is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a ‚Äúshe‚Äù, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>

<p>Being called ‚Äúshe‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as ‚Äúshe‚Äù, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It‚Äôs cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn‚Äôt use the same defition of ‚Äúshe‚Äù as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>

      <p>When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.</p>

<p>For the past five years, I‚Äôve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates. There‚Äôs a skate store around the block from my house, and whenever I‚Äôd pass it, I‚Äôd find myself right back in the best part of my childhood. For five years, though, I never got around to actually buying them.</p>

<p>Until Covid.</p>

<p>Much like what seems everyone in Amsterdam and their grandmother, I‚Äôve finally purchased a nice pair of skates. I got FR freeskates with three 110mm wheels as well as the protection gear I was always too cool to wear as a child. And when I say ‚Äúeveryone and their grandmother‚Äù, I mean enough people to keep me waiting for those skates for two weeks.</p>

<p>As a person who appreciates the (near-)instant gratification of next-day-delivery, waiting two weeks for a purchase to arrive seemed like an eternity.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I did with that eternity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Watched at least ten hours of freeskating flow videos</li>
  <li>Contemplated whether I should cancel my order and find less amazing skates that would arrive sooner</li>
  <li>Reminisce about how awesome skating felt when I was a child</li>
</ul>

<p>It was probably due to all this reminiscing that the concept of skating turned into an activity that you can‚Äôt unlearn, much like biking. My body remembered all the slides I could do, and the countless ways to stop. I figured I‚Äôd be able to take my skates out to the park within the first week or so.</p>

<p>Then they arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, twenty years afer I last skated, I unboxed and attempted to get into the skates. It took 30 minutes to figure out how to unlock the cuffs alone. Then it took ten minutes per skate to get the things on my feet. I‚Äôve been awkwardly rolling around the living room ever since, grabbing onto chairs and door frames, unsure of which muscles I need to keep from falling and breaking off my front teeth.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm nowhere near old enough to complain about aging or being too old for shit, but at 33, I‚Äôm slowly embracing the concept of micro-aging. From time to time, I will meet something that confirms that my body, my mind, and my experiences have changed drastically from what they were when I was a child. From time to time, something will remind me that I‚Äôm no longer 17, and right now, skating is it.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I<br />
feel that I am<br />
a <br />
bad<br />
Black<br />
girl<br />
because whenever<br />
my white girlfriend<br />
and I sift through<br />
Netflix<br />
Prime Video<br />
or anything<br />
with a reasonable trial<br />
period<br />
and she says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs <br />
watch this<br />
movie or that‚Äù<br />
featuring Black stories <br />
I instead<br />
elect to watch a white<br />
narrative<br />
because it‚Äôs nice<br />
to forget <br />
about <br />
racism<br />
and the teacher<br />
who called me <br />
a monkey<br />
and<br />
the no one<br />
who called him<br />
out<br />
and<br />
being a bit<br />
Black<br />
and being<br />
a bit<br />
white</p>
