      <p>My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would love to have another life, 
just so I could spend it cursing
at everything, and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The negative character of this man is self-evident. He‚Äôs as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories. It makes hanging out with him a free afternoon at a comedy club. His lifestyle is perfectly suited for his disposition. I‚Äôm positive his house contains more rooms than even he can count. There is a room for his art, another one for the art his students produce, various studios, six bathrooms, and three separate kitchens. He lives alone where he is boss.</p>

<p>Paul is also much older than I am, think a young grandfather. I expect that his age plays a large part in how comfortable he is low-key hating everybody. I‚Äôm not so lucky. Whenever I find myself muttering that ‚ÄúI hate people‚Äù, my self-talk quickly turns to shame and guilt. What if mankind is, in fact, nice, and I just happen to not see it? What if all those people on trains producing noises that make me want to explode would happily carry on a conversation with me, if only I was open to some fun?</p>

<p>Sometimes I think it would be incredible to have a door in my house, one that only I have the key to. It opens to a world exactly like this, except that nobody there can hear me scream and curse. I would hang out there on occasion, using profanity so profane that Satan would eventually have to come in to please ask me to simmer down because I was offending all the racist, nazi pedophiles in the hottest, darkest corners of hell.</p>

<p>It isn‚Äôt so much that I am mad at anyone specific, but more so the earth as a whole with everything and everyone on it, including myself. Or maybe I‚Äôm not even mad, but rather afraid? I mean, that‚Äôs where anger sometimes comes from, right? Maybe if I take a pillow and shout into it really loudly, and then go back to doing whatever, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120114230620/http://itllbebetter.com/">it‚Äôll be better</a>, and I‚Äôll be able to get on with my day, working steadily towards artistic retirement in which I smoke excessively at my kitchen table like Paul, worrying about how many lives I need for all my expletives.</p>

      <p>What is the deal with people and coffee? No, let‚Äôs try that again. What is the deal with people and dish water? Coffee<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> these days. Is. Disgusting.</p>

<p>A Starbucks recently opened in Utrecht, and to celebrate the occassion, a dear friend of mine, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen in two years, suggested we meet there for a pumpkin spiced whatever.</p>

<p>Pat, I‚Äôd love to buy a middle finger. Or else perhaps just a question mark.</p>

  <li>Times a day I realize I probably don‚Äôt want kids: 17.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm terrified of failing University. During the day I‚Äôm scared, and when I‚Äôm not scared, I‚Äôm asleep. I‚Äôm a 4.5 GPA.</li>
