          <p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>

<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>

<p>By now it is such a cliché to even say it, but I don’t like the monolith that we’ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn’t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>

<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I’ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

          <p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

          <p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>

<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they’re too bready.</p>

<p>In the window of Meijssen they’re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They’re surprisingly good.</p>

          <p>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I’m a part, a White lesbian asked me: “when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like <em>me</em> join?”</p>

<p>“Great questions,” I said, “my response is identical to what you would say if someone went ‘why do you need lesbian bars? You don’t see me going to a straight bar, do you?’”</p>

<p>“Fair enough” said the White lesbian.</p>

<p>I found an app called <a href="https://liberatemeditation.com/">Liberate</a>. It has beautiful meditations by Black and Indigenous teachers. I’ve always been a Headspace fan. Despite founder Andy’s cringey “I lived with the monks so you didn’t have to” marketing strategy, I appreciate the app for its interface and quality content. It hadn’t occured to me that the experiences I have as an Afropean could find their place in a meditation practice.</p>

<p>Part of me feels too indulgent for enjoying Liberate as much as I do. Listening to meditation teachers who have the understanding that microagressions are an actual reality in my actual life is just so different and amazing. Still, my subconscious feels sorry for the theoretical White people who would be uncomfortable if they found out I listen to Black meditations. <em>Why even bring your identity into it?!</em> Like a lesbian momentarily forgetting she’s allowed her lesbian bar.</p>
