      <p>Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesn‚Äôt land me in a FOMO-inducing Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. It‚Äôs another one of the habits I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. It‚Äôs pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also one of the few moments of solitude and focus I allow myself this week, apparently. Now that I‚Äôm beginning to reintegrate back into work at Leeruniek, I seem to have forgotten how much down time my body still requires. I‚Äôve received a work assignment, on which I‚Äôll get to work independently, and I‚Äôm excited. Curious. Hungry. On the cusp of small-scale overdrive. I had to stop working precisely because of this.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs boring.</p>

<p>Then I remember and old way to find calm and relaxation. <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/">The voices of Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant, telling me about stuff I should know</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whats-top-of-mind-right-now">What‚Äôs top of mind right now</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Saw Hannah Gadsby‚Äôs <em>Body of Work</em> and had a brief, cogent crush on her</li>
  <li>Saw a large number of Twitter folks join the much kinder Mastodon club. I‚Äôm slowly beginning to feel comfortable about the platform, and how it invites me to share my thoughts.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm thinking a lot about what ex-Twitter designer <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@jon@social.lot23.com/109372263710282940">Jon Bell</a> said about Twitter‚Äôs user experience trajectory. I keep saying out loud how central the difference between doing the righ thing and doing the thing right is to the design work I do.</li>

      <p>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work for me, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.</p>

<p>I finished reading <em>The Midnight Library</em>, which I had borrowed from <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">Annelie</a>. It sure has been a long time since I last read a book that was both so entertaining and easygoing. It feels borderline young adult, and entirely unpretentious.</p>

      <p>Each year I‚Äôm less embarrassed to say it: I don‚Äôt like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there‚Äôs King‚Äôs Day and Liberation Day, and I‚Äôve found it really messes with my head. I don‚Äôt mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.</p>

<p>This week, I learn that bolognese is a great base for chili, as long as you add enough cumin, beef, and beer. We watch <em>The Undoing</em>, which is a surprisingly great decision of Hugh Grant.</p>

      <p>Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.</p>

<p>I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know <em>everything</em> about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak. He laughs when I bop his nose, although I quickly learn that the force with which I bop Anja‚Äôs adult nose shan‚Äôt be applied here.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a French bakery in Amsterdam that I visit on Wednesday with my colleague Ruby. Since their actual oven is somewhere else, I wonder if the shop even calls itself a bakery. After all, French standards would forbid it. The caramel √©clair reminds me of that time at <a href="https://www.un-dimanche-a-paris.com/">Un Dimanche √† Paris</a>, a high I‚Äôve been chasing since mid-2018. The bread has been in the window too long. I ask if they have plastic bags, and I‚Äôm told no. I say I think that should be illegal in bakeries.</p>

<p>My childhood friend Mathilde comes for dinner on Sunday. Anja and I are giddy with excitement. In preparation, we practice our harmonies to Alanis Morissette‚Äôs ‚ÄúIronic‚Äùover voice messages. Her husband asks her if she, too, heard the cat meowing. We‚Äôre celebrating her birthday, and I got her gifts at <a href="http://www.javabookshop.nl/">Java Bookshop</a>. When I ask them about the East-Asian gay guy who writes letters to his mom, they immediately give me Ocean Vuong‚Äôs new book of poetry. Seeing her again, I better understand what It means to have a soulmate. I sing so loud I give myself a migraine. It‚Äôs worth it.</p>

<p>It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">mdx</a> in case I ever needed some more complexity in my content files. I would mostly update content through my desktop client, but have <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy</a> for iOS installed, which I enjoy as much as anyone could enjoy a touchscreen Git client. I was missing some functionalities that are natural to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault. I could make a spiel about how I love the ‚Äúslow web‚Äù-ness of writing things on my phone and only publishing them when I‚Äôm on my computer, but I simply haven‚Äôt figured out how to do it any other way.</p>
