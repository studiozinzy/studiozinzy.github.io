          <p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we‚Äôll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We‚Äôre meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I‚Äôm crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn‚Äôt one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I‚Äôve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world‚Äôs parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about intuition and consistency.</p>

          <p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky‚Äôs latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don‚Äôt: judge the film before I‚Äôve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I‚Äôm surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I‚Äôve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser‚Äôs stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they‚Äôre supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

          <p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I‚Äôd describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you‚Äôve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says ‚Äúwtf‚Äù and your heart goes ‚Äúyes‚Äù.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>

          Now that we've reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye ‚Äî and sometimes in the fabric ‚Äî of a hurricane.
