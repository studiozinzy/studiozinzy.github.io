        <title>The art of music theory</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>In a few days, I’ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>

<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there’s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I’m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>

<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you’re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I’ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>

<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life’s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

          <p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn’t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I’ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world’s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it’s all about intuition and consistency.</p>

        <title>'The Whale' for scale</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky’s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don’t: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

          <br />
          <p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I’d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you’ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says “wtf” and your heart goes “yes”.</p>

<p>I’ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>

          <p>Now that we’ve reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What made 2022 different isn’t its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted. In the wake of this interruption, everything seems easier.</p>

<p>My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was experiencing or facing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey that took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at <a href="https://humanconcern.nl/">Human Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022, as well as some of my favorite snapshots.</p>

<h3 id="i-finally-found-a-way-to-connect-with-that-intuition-everybody-has-been-raving-about">I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about</h3>
<p>I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what’s difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. Entering into that conversation, I’ve become better at noticing what effect everyday life has on me: the “rebound”, as we call it in yin yoga.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-flaw-that-neurodiversity-isnt">The design flaw that neurodiversity isn’t</h3>
<p>Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber who has shown me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sS00egAzg">how I can better organize things and, well, <em>do</em> them</a>. All of my life, I’ve been known to learn quickly, think originally, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I’m writing this, I’m already playing a pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago, but I can’t sustain a simple tidying routine to save my life.)</p>

<p>I was never unaware of what this meant or what it’s called, but what I never <em>got</em> was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency. That I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn’t stop trying until I could build habits like everyone else. I’ve never heard Elizabeth use the word “neurodiversity”, but it’s refreshing to hear from someone in whom I can see myself. Thanks to what I learned from her, I spent a good portion of 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, optimizing for passion rather than consistency.</p>

<h3 id="it-may-be-valuable-to-jumpstart-a-connection-by-oversharing-but-usually-it-isnt">It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn’t</h3>
<p>In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs. Outside of these relationships, though, 2022 showed me the value of pacing myself, friendship-wise. New people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can’t always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-worthwhile-stories">Surround yourself with worthwhile stories</h3>
<p>I’ve given up on the need to be a reader. I have a strong confirmation bias for the idea that I don’t read enough to justify the literature degree I have. Because of it, I see people basking in the light of the books they’re reading everywhere I go. Six weeks in the Algarve with no books except the Bible I didn’t touch did wonders for me. Instead of my usual feelings of guilt, I’m more discerning about the stories with which I surround myself. Life is too short to spend it feeding my brain and soul with things that don’t make me feel better, more excited, and more curious about life. This made it easy to skip <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_(TV_series)#Reception">Them</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html">The Whale</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing">Where the Crawdads Sing</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="firstly-im-a-designer">Firstly, I’m a designer</h3>
<p>In 2022 I realized that I don’t want to be a Product Manager. Since 2020 I’d been dabbling in the field, combining it with Design Management at my place of work, Leeruniek. Working as a Product Manager taught me volumes on strategic decision-making, big-picture thinking, and motivating an entire company behind a roadmap. It made me stellar at knowledge work. Sadly, it didn’t leave me enough room to do the things I truly love: product research and design, and the operational and leadership aspects associated with them. After my extended sick leave, I’m reintegrating back at work, thoroughly enjoying the researcher and designer I once again have become.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-i-learned">Other things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food is cool, but I must chill:</strong> with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for well over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. The lesson is that weeknight dishes don’t have to take longer than an hour to prepare. I’ve committed to this with varying degrees of success.</li>
  <li><strong>Dogs aren’t so bad after all:</strong> if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I’m known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he’s “suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”, and I’ve always proudly countered that with “don’t trust people who are suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”. That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.</li>

<h3 id="things-i-loved">Things I loved</h3>

<h4 id="in-the-cinema">In the cinema</h4>
<p>I made good use of my <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/">Cineville</a> card this year, seeing 19 films in different <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/theaters">film houses in Amsterdam</a>. These are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11559472/">Ali &amp; Ava</a>:</strong> I saw this three times in a fortnight, quickly falling in love with the sincerity and softness of the film (and, granted, also a bit with Claire Rushbrook). It propelled its title track “Radio” by Sylvan Esso to the top of my playlist.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/">Mass</a>:</strong> I love me a good kammerspiel, and <em>Mass</em> is a perfect example of it. The excellent cast, tension building, handling of covert Christian themes, and the pain around school shootings took my breath away.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13352968/">Good Luck To You, Leo Grande</a>:</strong> Anja took me to see this the day after I returned from Portugal. Emma Thompson, who has been my favorite actress and not-so-secret crush since <em>Love, Actually</em> is just pure on-screen bliss. I thought her and Daryl McCormack’s dynamic was electrifying.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/">Boiling Point</a>:</strong> this story is a fever dream, each scene making everything quietly worse than it already was. The one-take technique worked very well on me here, reminding me slightly of <em>Son of Saul</em> (to which Anja lets me compare nothing, but I’m not talking substance here), if it weren’t for the wider depth of field.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/">Triangle of Sadness</a>:</strong> this film worked incredibly well for me because I didn’t know what was going to happen. I read somewhere that the director thought that having his head in the editing process so deeply made him lose sight of just how gruesome the vomiting scene was, but I thought it was just perfect.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/">Nope</a>:</strong> this was my favorite film of the year. I need Jordan Peele to do well in life and art, and I’m glad he succeeded. The tangle of interpretations that <em>Nope</em> carries, combined with the sheer beauty and abundant safety of Black cinema made I had to see it twice in one week.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-my-ear">In my ear</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ubfQRrDsy6MEOKfptWEFt?si=70e6b75a48fa41cd">UK garage</a></strong>: I’m at that age where, suddenly, I realize that this 90s genre was the soundtrack of an entire decade of my life. Songs, their memories secretly stored in my body for later retrieval, come on and I go “oh my… GOD.” These days, UK garage is a perfect soundtrack for work.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1GIPP103zfsythULEpsmdw?si=e8af6a7cd6d74ed5">The Great Escape</a></strong>: this song by Patrick Watson, which I learned to play on my piano the minute I got it, was the soundtrack of an important moment during my time in Portugal. I know it may read as a suicide song, but to me it reads as something different entirely.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Qt8Z1LB3Fsrf6nhBNsvUJ?si=A9bEvaz7R7SOmX1r86zGTw"><em>Songs</em> by Adrianne Lenker</a></strong>: I don’t know what Adrianne sounds like at Big Thief, but her cabin-recorded set of quiet, almost mousy tunes, accompanied by beautifully simple guitar work, put its hooks into me in the autumn, and didn’t let go. “half return” is among my favorites.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6IiZemRMna678qNhiRkYI5?si=CvXOTbiRSiyFo6MnWs8Fcw">Bedouine</a></strong>: she is to me now what Norah Jones was to me twenty years ago. Like lying in a warm bath, like simmering down after a difficult day, like pouring hot tea into a thermos so I can have it for later. Hopefully moody, she is.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Xb6wJYGi0QXwURw5WWvI5?si=c4edaf562d154d15">Right Down the Line</a></strong>: in a genre I call “beards and log cabins”, this song by Gerry Rafferty is so successful at creating a vibe that I love. In Portugal, I listened to it on repeat.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5qxXZwGd1HEH12g8vRjr4J?si=8da62d3c045447f8">Best Friends</a></strong>: this is another single-repeat song from my Portugal playlist. Little Dragon made it such a mood, reminding me of early college, beer, and people I never knew.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6AAYNz8jXvVlgG9IpYi42Z?si=8b9ae3a327584c3b">Hunnybee</a></strong>: this song by Unknown Mortal Orchestra came to me shortly after I returned from Portugal. I like its ability to sound both careful and casual.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Here are my five objectives for 2023:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I continue working on recovering from my eating disorder</li>
  <li>I’ve developed and enjoy using new neurodivergent work and learning strategies</li>
  <li>I can play the piano well</li>
  <li>I can work fulltime again, doing things that excite me</li>
  <li>I’m a good dog parent</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also hoping to integrate vegetarian (and still nutritionally complete) dishes into our weeknight cooking cycle, and to begin exploring artists on an album-by-album case, rather than as part of playlists. I need 2023 to be steadier than 2022, but no less engaging and educational. I hope yours will be amazing, adventurous, filled with love, and that it’ll give you what you want <em>and</em> what you need.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

        <title>Week 51: The piano</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <ul>
  <li>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate!</li>
  <li>Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said “where are the tea lights?”, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don’t mind that we didn’t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</li>
  <li>This week was all about the new piano I bought. I can’t stop thinking or talking about it.</li>
  <li>All I’ll say is: this piano project is the first one I’m approaching through a neurodiverse lens, and it’s making everything <em>so</em> much smoother and funner.</li>
  <li>Illegally, I’m mentioning something that happened in week 50. A. took me for my annual Fancy Birthday Dinner. For the first time since we began dating, I told her to leave it a surprise. I suppose it’s one of those benefits of having gone to in-patient eating disorder treatment: chill vibes about food surprises. If you ever have an appetite for exquisite 10-course Asian fusion dining, book a table at <a href="https://101gowrie.com/">101 Gowrie</a>, where the atmosphere is as beautiful as the tableware, the bread is to cry over, and the umami is so intense that you’ll have trouble putting it into words.</li>
  <li>We needed a two-nighter to finish watching <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. I’m very much at that point in my mid-thirties where finishing a feature film under a warm blanket on the sofa after 8 p.m. is a challenge. I love whodunits — the genre might be in my top three — but I was quite disappointed to learn that both A. and I were able to guess the ending within the first five minutes. Janelle Monáe and Kathryn Hahn looked great nonetheless.</li>
  <li>All week, people kept asking me what I’d be doing for Christmas, and I’d cheerfully reply “Nothing! You?” every time. I feel liberated from the pressure to spend time with family or friends during the holidays, to eat more than I can carry, and to <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> fun. We certainly did have fun, just in a “really couldn’t be bothered” kind of way.</li>
  <li>I made my first batch of heavenly mud, a rich, creamy chocolate dessert. It was heavenly.</li>
</ul>

        <title>What I hate, fear, and suck at</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          A year ago, as part of my recovery journey, my therapist asked me: 'What are your core values? Like, what are your deepest needs and desires?' She reminded me last week that, instead of pausing to think of a response, I laughed straight in her face.
          
          <br />
          <p>A year ago, as part of my eating disorder recovery journey, my therapist asked me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are your core values? Like, what are your deepest needs and desires?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She reminded me last week that, instead of pausing to think of a response, I laughed straight in her face.</p>

<p>Historically, I’ve had trouble identifying what I want, need, desire, hope for, and dream of.</p>

<p>In-patient treatment has helped train that muscle, though. My first vision board there consisted of kind interactions with strangers in coffee houses, while other clients were planning to pursue a Master’s or travel the world. On the flight back I made my first-ever attempt at a bucket list.</p>

<p>Treatment taught me a hack that’s now helping me figure out what I hope 2023 will look like. Instead of identifying what I <em>do</em> hope, want, and yearn for, I look at what I <em>don’t</em>. What I hate can tell me something about what I fear. What I fear can, in turn, lead me to what I desire. Knowing what I suck at can help me identify challenges I might encounter as I move towards those desires.</p>

<p>As the year comes to a close, and as I figure out once again, but now from scratch, I’m asking myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do I hate?</li>
  <li>What do I fear?</li>
  <li>What do I suck at?</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than seeing my weak points as things I must improve in order to be healthy and happy, I try to figure out how I can use these characteristics to my benefit. I’m looking forward to optimizing <em>for</em> them, so I can have a realistic outlook as I learn and thrive.</p>

        <title>Week 48: Chinese food</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <ul>
  <li>The week was fairly quiet: I’m still having trouble getting enough rest, which leads to headaches and dizzy spells, but with enough breaks, naps, and beauty sleep I seem to be on a path to feeling better.</li>
  <li>I’m continuing to settle back into work, and I love working on my own design assignment. I can see how much I missed the tangible, practical design work, as well as design collaboration.</li>
  <li>Don’t tell Anja, but I indulged in a new Filofax setup for 2023. I got my hands on both their <a href="https://uk.filofax.com/collections/a5-refills-for-organisers-and-clipbook/products/minimal-week-to-view-diary-a5-2023">Week on Two Pages Diary</a>, and their <a href="https://uk.filofax.com/products/one-day-on-a-page-diary-with-appointments-a5-2023?_pos=1&amp;_sid=315704f6e&amp;_ss=r">One Day on a Page Diary</a>, to give myself ample space to organize. I’m quite exicted to try the week pages, which have a monthly planner section as well.</li>
  <li>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Floyd#Death_of_Suzanne_Sevakis">Girl In The Picture</a>, and all I can say is: I have quite the stomach for gruesome stories, but this shook me.</li>
  <li>I also watched <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11188206/">15 Minutes of Shame</a></em> and I loved it, particularly the connection they made to medieval punishment. It made me think back to my time as a student, getting acquainted with medieval literature for the first time.</li>
  <li>I had the 👏🏽  best 👏🏽  Chinese 👏🏽  food of my life, at <a href="https://www.hoitin.nl/">Hoi Tin</a>.</li>

        <title>Week 47: Booster</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <ul>
  <li>I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long. I mimic my late stepfather, who used to wimper like a puppy whenever he got a cold.</li>
  <li>I still do well to limit my hours of screen time. Before I know it, I’m stuck with a headache and dizzy spell.</li>
  <li>Spotify’s Discover Weekly was on point this week. Aside from lovely “beards and log cabin” tunes, as I call 70s soft rock, I’ve fallen hard for the hyper pop track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4n0sVfRnd0UJsqcbPj7GqN?si=Z5yeyS2xTjOEWlOSI5EnmQ">“Notice”</a> by Moe Shop and Toriena.</li>
  <li>We raced through another season of <em>The Crown</em>, this time with the excellent Elizabeth Debicki as Diana. I love how she manages to capture Diana so well despite <em>and</em> because of her camp-adjacent interpretation of her. I wonder if she ever got a sore neck during taping.</li>
  <li>After protesting for weeks, I’ve finally let Anja turn on the heating. So far, I haven’t had much up-close experience with the energy crisis the world is currently facing, and I don’t want that to change. It’s great to feel my toes, though.</li>
