    <p>Thinking about visual literacy, in part because the bulk of <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">Anja</a>’s academic work is focused on it right now, but also because I just love telling people off whenever they say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/07/a-novel-idea-is-the-book-always-better-than-the-film">“the book is better than the movie”</a>.</p>

    <p>I’m interested in learning about buddhism, but I don’t know where to start. Everything seems either too technical or too Pinterst quotesque. A trusted source tells me Pema Chödrön, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Herman Hesse’s <em>Siddharta</em> are good entry point. Off we go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve been [[mentoring]] over on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a> for a while now, and I can only say I’m truly enjoying it. It’s great to work with researchers, designers, and product managers in different stages of their careers.</p>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>After months of being, in essense, a recruitment manager, we added two new amazing talents to our team. I have one more role to fill, but I’m very pleased that the bulk of my time at work now goes to research, **strategy, mentoring, and operations. Feels good to be back. In all of it, I’m working to rely on my intuition, and to ask [[Seven questions</td>
          <td>good questions]].</td>

    <p>I’ve been experimenting with new dishes:</p>

  <li>
    <p>[[Teriyaki steak rolls]]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[[Miso Yaki Onigiri]]</p>
  </li>

    <p>We’ve been into [[The Staircase]]. I remember watching it years ago, and now that the rather satisfying HBO series is available, we’re rewatching the documentary for extra context. It’s striking to see what role anti-queer rhetoric played in the investigation and media coverage.</p>

    <p>Things look a little bit different on this site, and that’s mainly because I built it again, this time using Maxime Vaillancourt’s <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">digital garden Jekyll template</a>.</p>
