<p>For the past year and a half I‚Äôve been on a journey to take better care of myself. Part of this journey has been (re)defining what habits mean, to me. With a plethora of books, podcasts, videos, and apps dedicated to helping the audience develop better habits, I felt like I had lost any connection I had to the word. The quantified and often competitive nature of such platforms had me focus on extrinsic (seeing a green checkmark or a visualization of a streak) rather than intrinsic motivation.</p>

<h2 id="habits-ive-been-cultivating">Habits I‚Äôve been cultivating</h2>

<h3 id="yoga-practice">Yoga practice</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve been a casual practitioner of yoga for about fifteen years now. These last few years I‚Äôve begun concentrating on yin yoga and nidra yoga. I prefer an implementation of yoga that is provided by small-group, non-athletic, seemingly homely settings. For a while, I practised at Delight Yoga, which has a number of large spaces in the city. In recent times, I‚Äôve come to enjoy Thrive Yoga, which is close to my house, and incredibly small.</p>

<h3 id="meditation">Meditation</h3>
<p>I incorporate meditation into my life where I can, alternating unguided meditation and guided meditation with my favorite app. Lately, I‚Äôve been playing around with the Marina Abramovic Method, which isn‚Äôt so much a straight-forward meditation technique as it is something that sits in between meditating and playing.</p>
