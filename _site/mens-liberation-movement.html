<p>The men‚Äôs liberation movement came on my radar in recent years as a healthy way of approaching the topic of The Patriarchy‚Ñ¢. It‚Äôs a growing, diverse movement of people who criticize and question the surprisingly narrow boxes in which our societies tend to put men. When I got acquainted with <a class="internal-link" href="/standpoint-theory">standpoint theory</a>, two things dawned on me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unlike what I‚Äôve been taught ‚Äî and what I in turn began to teach myself ‚Äî cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white men do not have a monopoly on the truth</li>
  <li>Western societies (and perhaps others, too) perpetuate that misconception at the expense of not only everyone who is not a cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white man, but also at the expense of everyone who is</li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate how the men‚Äôs liberation movement learns from existing feminist frameworks about equality, dignity, and emancipation. Not because ‚Äúfinally men are learning from women‚Äù, but because it opens up a conversation that I didn‚Äôt think possible until the birth of this movement.</p>
