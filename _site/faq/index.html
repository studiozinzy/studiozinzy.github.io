    <p>Hey, I'm <a href="/">Zinzy Waleson</a>, a person online and in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I'm a researcher and designer making tools for people at work. Learn more about <a href="/about">me</a>, <a href="/colophon">this website</a> or what I'm up to <a href="/now">now</a>, say <a href="/hello">hello</a>, or visit the <a href="/archive">archive</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-you-may-want-from-me">Things you may want from me</h3>

<h4 id="im-thinking-of-moving-into-ux-can-we-chat">I‚Äôm thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?</h4>
<p>Sure! Check out my <a class="internal-link" href="/mentoring">mentoring</a> page to see if I have any availability.</p>

<h4 id="can-you-help-me-with-my-personal-brand--logo--website">Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?</h4>
<p>No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though: <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> gives most individual website owners what they need, and if you‚Äôre a one-person company you don‚Äôt need a logo.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-interview-you-for-my-podcast">Can I interview you for my podcast?</h4>
<p>Probably! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. Send me an <a class="internal-link" href="/about/">email</a> and I‚Äôll let you know if I have time.</p>

<h4 id="can-you-write-something-for-me">Can you write something for me?</h4>
<p>Maybe. On occasion, I write Scripture reflections or essays about queer Catholicism. If you‚Äôre interested in something like that, email me about your request and let‚Äôs chat!</p>

<h3 id="things-about-me">Things about me</h3>

<h4 id="you-call-yourself-a-product--design-manager-are-you-a-designer-or-a-product-manager">You call yourself a Product &amp; Design Manager. Are you a designer or a product manager?</h4>
<p>Both, but mostly I like to call myself a designer who manages product. I don‚Äôt see myself ever moving into product management that doesn‚Äôt involve design expertise. For companies such as <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  leeruniek 1  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, combining these two roles is a great fit, and I can see the same for many other start-ups and scale-ups.</p>
