<p>This page is part of Derek Sivers’ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">Now</a> movement. It contains a rough overview of what I’m up to or what’s top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where I’ve come from.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m interested to read some of Germaine Greer’s work. I like how, beyond the initial shock value of things she has said, there is a very blatant truth that I’m happy to engage with.</li>
  <li>After six weeks in the Algarve to continue recovering from an <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">eating disorder</a>, I’m readjusting to bustling Amsterdam and establishing new <a class="internal-link" href="/habits">habits</a>.</li>
  <li>Before Portugal, I was notoriously rubbish at dreaming about what I’d want my life to be like. I’ve returned with a renewed sense of agency, and a small-but-growing <a class="internal-link" href="/bucket-list">bucket list</a> to boot.</li>
  <li>Getting settled it at my new <a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">yoga</a> studio Thrive Yoga.</li>
  <li>Learning <a class="internal-link" href="/yiddish">Yiddish</a> in the early hours.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="april-2022">April 2022</h3>
<p>It’s odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. We’ve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>

<p>At Leeruniek, I’m focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. It’s great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We’re also hiring in the product team and we’ve already found a new engineer and a new designer. I’m looking forward to exploring our new team setup.</p>

<h3 id="september-2021">September 2021</h3>
<p>Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. I’m looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. I’m also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.</p>

<p>What I’m enjoying spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app, as well as CelinaSpookyBoo’s dad jokes and her accompanying laugh. I’ve been reading about chronic shame. I’ve been playing around with Gatsby starters for a bit, and I’m ready to begin building things from scratch.</p>
