      <p>Now that we‚Äôve reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye ‚Äî and sometimes in the fabric ‚Äî of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What makes this year different isn‚Äôt its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted.</p>

<p>My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was (or was eventually going to be) experiencing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey on which I‚Äôve been for a while now. The journey took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the hysterically beautiful lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at <a href="https://humanconcern.nl/">Human Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022.</p>

<h3 id="i-finally-found-a-way-to-connect-with-that-intuition-everybody-has-been-raving-about">I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about.</h3>
<p>I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously slowing and simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what‚Äôs difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. Entering into that conversation, I‚Äôve become better at noticing what effect everyday life has on me: the ‚Äúrebound‚Äù as we call it in <a class="internal-link" href="/notes/Yin%20yoga/">yin yoga</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-flaw-that-neurodiversity-isnt">The design flaw that neurodiversity isn‚Äôt</h3>
<p>Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber who has shown me how I can better organize things and <em>do</em> them.</p>

<p>whose work on productivity has meant wonders for me. All of my life, I‚Äôve been known to learn quickly, think unusually, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm already playing pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago.)</p>

<p>I was never unaware of what this meant or what it‚Äôs called, but what I never <em>got</em> was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency, how I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn‚Äôt stop trying. I‚Äôve never heard Elizabeth use the word ‚Äúneurodiversity‚Äù, but it‚Äôs refreshing to hear from someone with whom I identify so strongly. Thanks to what I learned from her, I‚Äôm spending 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, while optimizing for passion rather than consistency.</p>

<h3 id="it-may-be-valuable-to-jumpstart-a-connection-by-oversharing-but-usually-it-isnt">It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn‚Äôt.</h3>
<p>In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs.</p>

<p>I have a renewed appreciation for socially pacing myself, though. In 2022, new people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can‚Äôt always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting. Building relationships takes time, no matter how badly you want to ask a new and exciting person everything about their life.</p>

<p>Lastly, when I do share, I prefer snail mail over quarterly 10-minute voice recording updates over WhatsApp. I spent a portion of 2022 converting the way I keep in touch with people.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-worthwhile-stories">Surround yourself with worthwhile stories</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve given up on the need to read all the time. I have a strong confirmation bias for the notion that I don‚Äôt read enough, and I‚Äôll see people who are happily devouring books everywhere I turn. Six weeks with no books except a Bible I didn‚Äôt touch did wonders for me. The guilt I usually feel over this, especially as a literature graduate, is slowly melting away.</p>

<p>Somehow, 2022 helped me draw another conclusion: life is too short to spend it feeding myself with things that shouldn‚Äôt be crowding my mind. It makes it easy to refuse</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is why I won‚Äôt be seeing <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html">The Whale</a></em>, and decided that <em>Them</em> wouldn‚Äôt be for me either.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-other-things-i-learned">Some other things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food is cool, but I must chill:</strong> with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. Before I left, I would easily do seven- or ten-hour stints on weekdays<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. These days, I try to limit myself to an hour, with relative success.</li>
  <li><strong>Dogs aren‚Äôt so bad after all:</strong> if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I‚Äôm known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he‚Äôs ‚Äúsuspicious of¬†people who don‚Äôt like dogs‚Äù, and I‚Äôve always proudly countered that with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust people who are suspicious of people who don‚Äôt like dogs‚Äù. That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-at-heart-im-a-researcher">8. At heart, I‚Äôm a researcher</h3>

<p>One of the main aspects of my professional career has been knowledge work, and while I love nursing the skillset required for that work, I did discover this year that Product Management is not the path for me.</p>

<h3 id="9-eventually-we-become-our-own-perpetrators-its-a-health-hazard">9. Eventually we become our own perpetrators. It‚Äôs a <a class="internal-link" href="/notes/Health/">health</a> hazard.</h3>
