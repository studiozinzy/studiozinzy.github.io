      <p>Now that we‚Äôve reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye ‚Äî and sometimes in the fabric ‚Äî of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What made 2022 different isn‚Äôt its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted. In the wake of this interruption, everything seems easier.</p>

<p>My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was experiencing or facing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey that took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at <a href="https://humanconcern.nl/">Human Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022, as well as some of my favorite snapshots.</p>

<h3 id="i-finally-found-a-way-to-connect-with-that-intuition-everybody-has-been-raving-about">I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about</h3>
<p>I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what‚Äôs difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. Entering into that conversation, I‚Äôve become better at noticing what effect everyday life has on me: the ‚Äúrebound‚Äù, as we call it in yin yoga.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-flaw-that-neurodiversity-isnt">The design flaw that neurodiversity isn‚Äôt</h3>
<p>Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber who has shown me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sS00egAzg">how I can better organize things and, well, <em>do</em> them</a>. All of my life, I‚Äôve been known to learn quickly, think originally, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm already playing a pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago, but I can‚Äôt sustain a simple tidying routine to save my life.)</p>

<p>I was never unaware of what this meant or what it‚Äôs called, but what I never <em>got</em> was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency. That I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn‚Äôt stop trying until I could build habits like everyone else. I‚Äôve never heard Elizabeth use the word ‚Äúneurodiversity‚Äù, but it‚Äôs refreshing to hear from someone in whom I can see myself. Thanks to what I learned from her, I spent a good portion of 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, optimizing for passion rather than consistency.</p>

<h3 id="it-may-be-valuable-to-jumpstart-a-connection-by-oversharing-but-usually-it-isnt">It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn‚Äôt</h3>
<p>In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs. Outside of these relationships, though, 2022 showed me the value of pacing myself, friendship-wise. New people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can‚Äôt always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-worthwhile-stories">Surround yourself with worthwhile stories</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve given up on the need to be a reader. I have a strong confirmation bias for the idea that I don‚Äôt read enough to justify the literature degree I have. Because of it, I see people basking in the light of the books they‚Äôre reading everywhere I go. Six weeks in the Algarve with no books except the Bible I didn‚Äôt touch did wonders for me. Instead of my usual feelings of guilt, I‚Äôm more discerning about the stories with which I surround myself. Life is too short to spend it feeding my brain and soul with things that don‚Äôt make me feel better, more excited, and more curious about life. This made it easy to skip <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_(TV_series)#Reception">Them</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html">The Whale</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing">Where the Crawdads Sing</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="firstly-im-a-designer">Firstly, I‚Äôm a designer</h3>
<p>In 2022 I realized that I don‚Äôt want to be a Product Manager. Since 2020 I‚Äôd been dabbling in the field, combining it with Design Management at my place of work, Leeruniek. Working as a Product Manager taught me volumes on strategic decision-making, big-picture thinking, and motivating an entire company behind a roadmap. It made me stellar at knowledge work. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt leave me enough room to do the things I truly love: product research and design, and the operational and leadership aspects associated with them. After my extended sick leave, I‚Äôm reintegrating back at work, thoroughly enjoying the researcher and designer I once again have become.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-i-learned">Other things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food is cool, but I must chill:</strong> with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for well over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. The lesson is that weeknight dishes don‚Äôt have to take longer than an hour to prepare. I‚Äôve committed to this with varying degrees of success.</li>
  <li><strong>Dogs aren‚Äôt so bad after all:</strong> if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I‚Äôm known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he‚Äôs ‚Äúsuspicious of¬†people who don‚Äôt like dogs‚Äù, and I‚Äôve always proudly countered that with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust people who are suspicious of people who don‚Äôt like dogs‚Äù. That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.</li>

<h3 id="things-i-loved">Things I loved</h3>

<h4 id="in-the-cinema">In the cinema</h4>
<p>I made good use of my <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/">Cineville</a> card this year, seeing 19 films in different <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/theaters">film houses in Amsterdam</a>. These are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11559472/">Ali &amp; Ava</a>:</strong> I saw this three times in a fortnight, quickly falling in love with the sincerity and softness of the film (and, granted, also a bit with Claire Rushbrook). It propelled its title track ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù by Sylvan Esso to the top of my playlist.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/">Mass</a>:</strong> I love me a good kammerspiel, and <em>Mass</em> is a perfect example of it. The excellent cast, tension building, handling of covert Christian themes, and the pain around school shootings took my breath away.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13352968/">Good Luck To You, Leo Grande</a>:</strong> Anja took me to see this the day after I returned from Portugal. Emma Thompson, who has been my favorite actress and not-so-secret crush since <em>Love, Actually</em> is just pure on-screen bliss. I thought her and Daryl McCormack‚Äôs dynamic was electrifying.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/">Boiling Point</a>:</strong> this story is a fever dream, each scene making everything quietly worse than it already was. The one-take technique worked very well on me here, reminding me slightly of <em>Son of Saul</em> (to which Anja lets me compare nothing, but I‚Äôm not talking substance here), if it weren‚Äôt for the wider depth of field.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/">Triangle of Sadness</a>:</strong> this film worked incredibly well for me because I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen. I read somewhere that the director thought that having his head in the editing process so deeply made him lose sight of just how gruesome the vomiting scene was, but I thought it was just perfect.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/">Nope</a>:</strong> this was my favorite film of the year. I need Jordan Peele to do well in life and art, and I‚Äôm glad he succeeded. The tangle of interpretations that <em>Nope</em> carries, combined with the sheer beauty and abundant safety of Black cinema made I had to see it twice in one week.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-my-ear">In my ear</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ubfQRrDsy6MEOKfptWEFt?si=70e6b75a48fa41cd">UK garage</a></strong>: I‚Äôm at that age where, suddenly, I realize that this 90s genre was the soundtrack of an entire decade of my life. Songs, their memories secretly stored in my body for later retrieval, come on and I go ‚Äúoh my‚Ä¶ GOD.‚Äù These days, UK garage is a perfect soundtrack for work.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1GIPP103zfsythULEpsmdw?si=e8af6a7cd6d74ed5">The Great Escape</a></strong>: this song by Patrick Watson, which I learned to play on my piano the minute I got it, was the soundtrack of an important moment during my time in Portugal. I know it may read as a suicide song, but to me it reads as something different entirely.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Qt8Z1LB3Fsrf6nhBNsvUJ?si=A9bEvaz7R7SOmX1r86zGTw"><em>Songs</em> by Adrianne Lenker</a></strong>: I don‚Äôt know what Adrianne sounds like at Big Thief, but her cabin-recorded set of quiet, almost mousy tunes, accompanied by beautifully simple guitar work, put its hooks into me in the autumn, and didn‚Äôt let go. ‚Äúhalf return‚Äù is among my favorites.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6IiZemRMna678qNhiRkYI5?si=CvXOTbiRSiyFo6MnWs8Fcw">Bedouine</a></strong>: she is to me now what Norah Jones was to me twenty years ago. Like lying in a warm bath, like simmering down after a difficult day, like pouring hot tea into a thermos so I can have it for later. Hopefully moody, she is.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Xb6wJYGi0QXwURw5WWvI5?si=c4edaf562d154d15">Right Down the Line</a></strong>: in a genre I call ‚Äúbeards and log cabins‚Äù, this song by Gerry Rafferty is so successful at creating a vibe that I love. In Portugal, I listened to it on repeat.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5qxXZwGd1HEH12g8vRjr4J?si=8da62d3c045447f8">Best Friends</a></strong>: this is another single-repeat song from my Portugal playlist. Little Dragon made it such a mood, reminding me of early college, beer, and people I never knew.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6AAYNz8jXvVlgG9IpYi42Z?si=8b9ae3a327584c3b">Hunnybee</a></strong>: this song by Unknown Mortal Orchestra came to me shortly after I returned from Portugal. I like its ability to sound both careful and casual.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Here are my five objectives for 2023:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I continue working on recovering from my eating disorder</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve developed and enjoy using new neurodivergent work and learning strategies</li>
  <li>I can play the piano well</li>
  <li>I can work fulltime again, doing things that excite me</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm a good dog parent</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm also hoping to integrate vegetarian (and still nutritionally complete) dishes into our weeknight cooking cycle, and to begin exploring artists on an album-by-album case, rather than as part of playlists. I need 2023 to be steadier than 2022, but no less engaging and educational. I hope yours will be amazing, adventurous, filled with love, and that it‚Äôll give you what you want <em>and</em> what you need.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
