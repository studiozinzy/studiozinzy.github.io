I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant building your own photo blog. This instilled in me a deep appreciation for hand-crafted websites, one of which you're visiting right now.

### Technical details
- I write this website in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), which [Jekyll {{site.jekyllversion}}](https://jekyllrb.com/) turns into a website
- The code lives in [Github](https://github.com/zinzy) and is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Photographs are served through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- I've styled 

### To do
- Reinstate digital garden
- Type-specific tag colors
- [Universal tags for posts and notes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives/pull/88)
- Add way to respond to a page
