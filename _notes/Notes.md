excerpt: "My growing index of public notetaking"

I've been maintaining a single folder of plain text notes for about two decades now. Many of these notes are private. Some, however, make it into this public place, a digital garden of sorts. I let it be a place where mistakes can live, [[Ideas can change]], and where questions are more important than answers.

As an act of [[Anti-marketing]], although I believe that, on the Internet very little of the sort can exist, I write these notes for me, not for you. Because of this, there is no index. Rather, it's a scavenger hunt of sorts. 

Good places to start are [[Now]], and [[Consumption]].
