The website you're currently looking at is an example of an [[indieweb]] website: a personal site hand-crafted by the owner, using a variety of tools to show text and other types of media. The personal website is among my favorite things in the world, and I've had one for as long as I've been on the Internet.

### The anatomy of the personal website
A personal website is a web page or a cluster thereof showcasing anything the owner cares to share: examples of work, essays in blog form, snapshots, discovered links, whatever you can think of. It is the website version of the oft-seen Twitter bio "views are my own".

Many people choose to segregate the personal information they share on a personal website. Some limit it to their work, others to their goings-on at home. Some use a single domain to share everything, like me.
