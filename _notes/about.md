excerpt: "I'm a person on the Internet and in Amsterdam."

Hey there, thank you for visiting my personal site! I've been using this space (and before it, others) to navigate the web since I was eleven years old. I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet ([read more about what that means for this website](/colophon)). This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. You'll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare. 

## In life
I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, I'm a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.


## At work
For the past fifteen years I've been making a living as a researcher and designer of digital products. I've worked across a variety of industries, and with startups and small business owners as well as industry leaders. For the past seven years I've been specializing in making [[tools for people at work]].
