I'm Zinzy Waleson, a person on the Internet. I taught myself how to build websites when I was eleven, and I've used this skill to navigate the Internet ever since. I'm a diarist, a home cook, music maker, and cinephile. I'm also a designer, researcher, and product person working on education technology. I live and work in Amsterdam, where I share a shoe box with my partner.
