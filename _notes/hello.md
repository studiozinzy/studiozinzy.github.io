Hello, I'm [[About|Zinzy Waleson]]!

I love the intersection of design, research, and strategy, and I also love cooking, making music, yoga, reading, and cinema.

I enjoy meeting new people. If you have something to share, you'd like to play or learn together, or can think of any othe reason we should be talking, get in touch with me. This is my [hello](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/) page, where you can learn how I like to keep in touch. 

How to contact me:
- Some of your questions might be answered by my [[faq]] page
- For any inquiry, please send me an email via my [[contact|contact form]]
- I write on my [[index|website]]
- I'm currently on hiatus from mentoring, but if you'd like to plan sessions with me in the future, shoot me an [[contact|email]]
- If you'd like to know what I'm doing at the moment, visit my [[now]] page
- If you have my number, give me a call (I love phone calls). If I don't pick up, leave me a message or send a text
- I infrequently check [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@zinzy) because I like things that are decentralized
- If you think we are or should be acquainted in a professional manner, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/zinzy)
- While you may find social media accounts in my name, I do not use these accounts anymore. It's good to know I won't see any message you may send me, and I won't receive a notification of it.
