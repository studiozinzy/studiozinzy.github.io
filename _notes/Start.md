## What this is
You've reached the personal website of me, Zinzy Waleson, a researcher and designer from Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. You may start by learning more [[About|about me]].

## How to use this website
This website is a happy mishmash of things I've written since I first learned how to build websites in the 90s. It's part diary, part digital garden, part unpretentious portfolio. At the moment, I'm sifting through my archives to find lost gems, and the digital garden is growing every day. Currently, there are <span>{{ site.notes | size }}</span> undated notes that are perpetually subject to change.

Here are some places to start:
- My [[Diary]]
- My [[Now]] page, which will tell you what I'm up to
- [[Consumption]], about what I'm attending, reading, watching
- [[Bookmarks]], containing links of the websites I like
