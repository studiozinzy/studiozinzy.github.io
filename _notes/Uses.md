I maintain this page as an incomplete overview of the things I love to use. Kind of like [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), but more focused on things that happen outside of a computer.

### Stationery
- I only use one pen: the [Uni-ball Eye Micro in black](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Eye-Rollerball-Pen-0.5-mm-Black/pd/12016)

### Kitchen
- I've inherited Anja's kitchen utensil snobbery and have become a big fan of[ Le Creuset's silicone spatula series](https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas). I wouldn't know how to cook a proper meal without them.

### Luggage
- Over the Summer, I got myself a [Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010). Fanny packs are notoriously sizeist, but luckily this pack's extra belt makes for a create extension, giving me the support I need.
