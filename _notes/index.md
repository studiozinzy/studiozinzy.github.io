You'll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts. I deliberately underplay the work I do, not because it is so spectacular, but because this space is not a portfolio.

I'm an avid home cook, cinephile, casual writer, playful linguist, and gardener. For money, I'm a researcher and designer making [[tools for people at work]]. Feel free to learn more [[about]] me, or what I'm up to [[now]]. 

Visit [[hello]] if you need to speak with me, or continue browsing via [[collections]].
