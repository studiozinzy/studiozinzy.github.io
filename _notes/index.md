This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. You'll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts. I deliberately underplay the work I do, not because it is so spectacular, but because this space is not a portfolio.

There is no index or archive of its contents, so here are a few links to help you on your way:
- Learn more [[about]] me
- Check out what Iâ€™m up to [[now]]
- Visit [[hello]] if you need to speak with me
- Continue browsing via [[collections]]
