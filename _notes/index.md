## Digital garden
I keep a casual collection of unfinished thoughts; random snippets on a myriad of topics. Soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Currently, there are **65 notes** on the garden. I've set up my garden as a scavenger hunt, so there is no permanent archive.

Suggested starting points:
- [[About]]
- What I'm up to [[Now]]
