I've been a practitioner of yoga for about sixteen years now. These last few years I've begun concentrating on:

- **Yin yoga**, a slow-paced style of yoga that focuses on mild poses held for a longer period of time, which increases the practitioner's focus on boundaries and stretching them. I love yin because its goal is not to let our bodies land in a pose, but rather to let the pose help us better land in our bodies.
- **Yoga nidra**, a very quiet form of yoga usually induced by a guided meditation, which lets the practitioner land in a state between being awake and being asleep. I use nidra as a means of learning more about how much rest my body needs.

### How I like my yoga
- Slow paced
- Calm atmosphere
- A soundtrack made up of non-pop, low-lyric music
- Small number of participants
- Some soft talk of what may happen in my body during a pose
- Little talk of Asian [[Spirituality|spiritual practices]] 

### How I practice
At the moment, I practice yoga both at home and at my favorite studio, [Thrive Yoga](https://thriveyoga.nl/). It's a small space with great teachers, as well as the perfect atmosphere. Before this, I've tried out various studios in [[Amsterdam]], including Delight Yoga, Yoga Zenter, BlueBirds Yoga, and Sukha Yoga, mostly through OneFit.

### Yoga heroes
- The single most influential person for my yoga practice has been [Jessamyn Stanley](https://jessamynstanley.com/), a black, fat, queer yoga teacher from North Carolina. She has helped me embrace my body, accept the particularity of my practice, and has shown me that yoga is also for me.
