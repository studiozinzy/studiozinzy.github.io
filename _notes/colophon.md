title: "Colophon"
---
This is a personal website, designed, built, and maintained by [[about|yours truly]]. In nature, it is casual, unpretentious, and unassuming. On here, you'll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. It's organized as a casual collection of unfinished thoughts.

## Technical details
- This website is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a flat-file content management system I've been using for years. I like my familiarity with the platform, as well as the light-weight nature of flat-file systems.
- I've taken [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) digital garden template for Jekyll as my starting point. I continue to change it on an almost daily basis.
- The font you're looking at is whatever is native to your operating system.

## Setup
- This website lacks an archive or central index. Instead, it's a collection of linked files. I like that this is essentially a scavenger hunt.

## IndieWeb
I use this website to participate in the IndieWeb, a great community of people who enjoy tinkering on personal websites, as well as independence while they do so.

## To do
- Add a library
