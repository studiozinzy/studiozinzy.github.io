excerpt: "An unassuming overview of what I'm up to these days"

- I'm employed as User Experience and Product Manager of Leeruniek, a wonderful scale-up in education technology.
- Regretfully, I'm exhausted, and on sick leave. Sleeping helps.
- For the past few months, I've let unguided [[meditation]] grow on me. I bought a wonderful [meditation pillow](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/doyouryoga-yoga-kussen-ganesh-halve-maan-meditatiekussen-met-bio-organische-boekweit-schalen-vulling-45x30x14-cm-donkergroen/9200000081535284/?bltgh=q1fAh2dTBzIiwFveATNKEw.2_6.28.ProductTitle) that is absolutely comfortable.

## "Reading"
- I'm reading Nell Zink's _The Wallcreeper_, which is delightfully peculiar, and blessed with the, as [_New Yorker_'s Kathryn Schulz](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/outside-in) put it beautifully, "unimprovable opening sentenceâ€” 'I was looking at the map when Stephen swerved, hit the rock, and occasioned the miscarriage'." So far, I'd recommend.
- We're making our way through _The Sopranos_, me for the tenth time while it's Anja's first. One recommendation I can make for those eager to watch it (again) is that they should sign up for my new favorite subreddit [r/thesopranos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/), which is filled to the brim with fans who do their best to use as many quotes as they can. It is seriously my favorite spot on the Internet these days.
