excerpt: "The company I've been with since 2020"

Since late 2020 I've been a part of the wonderful team of [Leeruniek](https://www.leeruniek.nl), a scale-up in education technology that was founded in 2015. I joined them because I liked what they told me about using data for good, about equity in education, and about working autonomously in a design-forward product team.

## Why I love working at Leeruniek
If you're considering joining us, here are some honest opinions:
- We operate from a standpoint of generous assumptions
- Employees are invited to be proactive and autonomous
- The product team is integrated, and tight-knit
