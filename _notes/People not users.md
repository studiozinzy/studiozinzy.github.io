In my professional capacity, I find myself among many people making a point to say that treating people like users is bad. Even outside of the design and product world there seems to be a growing understanding of how important it is for us to retain our sense of humanity as we travel the Internet. It's 2022, and the average joe has at least some understanding of how expensive privacy, attention, and autonomy really are on the web.

### The anatomy of a user
The growing body of product knowledge has the tendency to — unintentionally — establish unappetizing metaphors about users:

- User as a scenario
- User as a number
- User as an addict

### The right thing

> Understanding users helps us to the thing right, understanding people helps us do the right thing.
