Simmering down is a challenge this week. I wake, daily before 6am, and jump straight into the day. My jump doesn't land me in a personalized Instagram feed or a busy news site, but on a blank screen that waits eagerly as I type my 1,000 words of the morning. It's another one of the [[Habits]] I picked up this autumn. Me, the darkness outside, and a soft light in the living room acquainting me with the day. It's pleasing to meet myself, unfiltered. 






### What's top of mind right now

- Saw Hannah Gadsby's [[Body of Work]] and had a brief, cogent crush on her
- Saw a large number of Twitter folks join the much kinder Mastodon club
- Thought about what Jon Bell shared about the user experiences of Twitter, and how important it is for me to remember that appreciating the difference between [[Do the right thing|doing the right thing]] and [[Do the thing right|doing the thing right]] is central to how I operate as a designer.
