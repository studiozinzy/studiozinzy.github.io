Today and tomorrow I'm attending [UXinsight Festival 2022](uxinsight-festival-2022) and keeping notes. TIL that, for a brief moment in time in Tikrit, Iraq, there was a [three-meter copper statue of a shoe that was thrown at George W Bush in 2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_shoeing_incident). I've been working with these guys for over a year and a half now. It took me until today to realize they weren't talking about "Kubernetics". I'm curious to see how [Harald](https://volse.net/~haraldei/) handles his website's dark mode. Watching an [adorable documentary on early Internet culture](https://youtu.be/PuAbCgGpeog). Thinking about overconnectedness in the meantime. Signed the [Web0 manifesto](https://web0.small-web.org/#zinzy-waleson). Delighted to meet Elliott Cost at [Niemeijer](/niemeijer). I don't often meet people in real life who are into personal web publishing. We discussed the value of writing hand-coded HTML pages with only CSS.
