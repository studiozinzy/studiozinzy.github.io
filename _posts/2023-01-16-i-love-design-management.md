[As I already mentioned earlier today on Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109698329736256912), one of my favorite things about design work is getting to help other designers solve their own problems.

As one of the designers on my team and I were discussing how to leverage research to benefit stakeholder relationships, I saw a light switch on in her head that I think we'd have trouble turning off if we even wanted to. It's so satisfying to see that happen, simply by mentioning a framework, sharing a bit of background on a particular research method, or on strategizing research within a product development process.

Coming back from product management into design management lets me focus wholeheartedly on this part of my skillset. I'm still not fully back at work (doing five hours a day now), but with encounters like this I'm beginning to feel more and more a part of the team again.

And I wouldn't want it any other way.
