The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never feel like there is a style that suits me. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.  

I finished reading _The Midnight Library_, which I had borrowed from [Annelie](https://www.anneliewambeek.com/). It sure has been a long time since I last read a book that was both so entertaining and easygoing. It feels borderline young adult, and entirely unpretentious.
