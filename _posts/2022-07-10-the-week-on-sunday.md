## This just in
- I'm on sick leave, and I never realized how tiring it is to have this much time to ask myself "what do I need?" 
- Anja was in an accident and is at home recovering from a dislocated shoulder. Apparently she's not the first to trip over a loose tile on the bike path. When ER doctors were putting her shoulder back, I could hear her across the hospital.

## What I learned this week
- Some religions respond to religious law by building [elevators that stop on every floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_elevator), this I knew. New to me entirely is the concept of [soaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soaking_(sexual_practice)), which may or may not be a Morman way to circumvent the prohibition of premarital intercourse.

## My favorite moment
