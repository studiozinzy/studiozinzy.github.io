## Heya, I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene

I'm a researcher, designer, and queer facilitator from [[Amsterdam]], currently managing UX at [[Leeruniek]]. I specialize in building digital products for [[People not users|#peoplenotusers]] at work.

I'm also a facilitator making resonant queer spaces in the city and on the Internet. I'm the founder and host of [[Queer Salon]], a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam.

This is my website, a vastly personal project. It contains soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Put your feet up, stay a while. If you find anything that needs my attention, will you [[hello|let me know]]?
