At the time of writing, January 11, 2023, this page is unlisted on my website. I suspect this project will turn out to be nothing at all, but wouldn't it be so fun if I could do this successfully?

The first time the number 1095 began to carry any significance to me was [The 1095 Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20061215051700/http://1095.naughtyjames.com/), a photo blog project by London-based photographer Craig Cowling (known then as Naughty James), which ran from December 15 2003 - 2006. A photograph, often without words, every day for three years straight. 20 years later, I'm still not over it.


### Principles
- Show up: show up and publish
- Don't bother drafting: drafts make the idea of writing online bigger than it needs to be. Write about now: what's happening today? What are you feeling here? What were you thinking earlier?
